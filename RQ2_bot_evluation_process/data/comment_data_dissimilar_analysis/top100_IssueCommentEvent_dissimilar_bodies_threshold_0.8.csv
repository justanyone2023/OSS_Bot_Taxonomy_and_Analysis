@mutability, you have to keep in mind that the ckans from the api have modified download URLs... Just remember to rename them back if you use them as a basis for your own ones :)

I think most Linux distributions today support ```xdg-open```. Running ```xdg-open path``` in a terminal starts my file manager with the requested path opened.

+1. This seems like a good idea.

KSP-CKAN/CKAN#211 is a variant of this. There might also be a ticket specifically for breaking saves, but I'm not sure where it is. In any case, the way of doing this would be to specify a minimum version at which the save breaking occurs.

Eg, going from Kerbxample 3 to Kerbxample 4 is save breaking, but from Kerbxample 4 to Kerbxample 4.1 is not. The version 4.x metadata would have a `compatible_to: 4.0` line (or equivalent). If the user's current version is less than the compatibility check, we give them a warning. (And I'd say it *must* have a human displayable warning, because otherwise users are told ""this may be save-breaking"", but no further details about that.)

Of course, I'd *really* love to see mods check if they've been upgraded from an older version and warn the user with an in-game message. Unfortunately, that's not always a straightforward process. (But it does mean the user gets informed no matter how they upgraded their mods.)

Another thing about the versionfield, which might or might not be relevant, is that it seems to contain other things than the version.

A clean KSP with only FAR installed will have this installed-default.ckan
```
    {
""spec_version"": ""v1.6"",
""identifier"": ""installed-default"",
""version"": ""2015.03.14.10.22.27"",
""license"": ""unknown"",
""name"": ""installed-default"",
""abstract"": ""A list of modules installed on the default KSP instance"",
""kind"": ""metapackage"",
""depends"": [
    {
        ""name"": ""AerodynamicModel"",
        ""version"": ""provided by FerramAerospaceResearch""
    },
    {
        ""name"": ""FAR"",
        ""version"": ""provided by FerramAerospaceResearch""
    },
    {
        ""name"": ""ModuleManager"",
        ""version"": ""2.5.10""
    },
    {
        ""name"": ""FerramAerospaceResearch"",
        ""version"": ""v0.14.6""
    }
]
        }
```
I'm pretty sure that `""provided by FerramAerospaceResearch""` isn't a version of something but maybe it's working as intended?

It also says something about getting a SIG_SEGV, so I'm thinking it has to do with the lack of mono 4.

6924409,IssueCommentEvent,"I agree with @PavelJacobo . If `sam build` can work out the directory structure correctly, so should `sam local start-api`. It is confusing that two have different behavior. I found the same problem with python. 

I guess `sam build` doesn't require the `python` or `nodejs` folder if the layer's build method is explicitly set to python or nodejs. I hope `sam local start-api` can do that too.

I guess the extra layer of `python`, `nodejs` or even `bin` is needed if we are building a generic layer, i.e. a layer can be shared by functions of different runtimes. "

55468070,IssueCommentEvent,"This pull request is protected by [Check Enforcer](https://aka.ms/azsdk/check-enforcer).
# What is Check Enforcer?
Check Enforcer helps ensure all pull requests are covered by at least one check-run (typically an Azure Pipeline). When all check-runs associated with this pull request pass then Check Enforcer itself will pass.
# Why am I getting this message?
You are getting this message because Check Enforcer did not detect any check-runs being associated with this pull request within five minutes. This may indicate that your pull request is not covered by any pipelines and so Check Enforcer is correctly blocking the pull request being merged.
# What should I do now?
If the **check-enforcer** check-run is not passing and all other check-runs associated with this PR are passing (excluding _license-cla_) then you could try telling _Check Enforcer_ to evaluate your pull request again. You can do this by adding a comment to this pull request as follows:
``` /check-enforcer evaluate ```
Typically evaulation only takes a few seconds. If you know that your pull request is not covered by a pipeline and this is expected you can override Check Enforcer using the following command:
``` /check-enforcer override ```
Note that using the override command triggers alerts so that follow-up investigations can occur (PRs still need to be approved as normal).
# What if I am onboarding a new service?
Often, new services do not have validation pipelines associated with them, in order to bootstrap pipelines for a new service, you can issue the following command as a pull request comment:
``` /azp run prepare-pipelines ```
This will run a pipeline that analyzes the source tree and creates the pipelines necessary to build and validate your pull request. Once the pipeline has been created you can trigger the pipeline using the following comment:
``` /azp run net - [service] - ci ```"

Hi! Thanks for the PR!

Unfortunately, the Go project doesn't use GitHub's Pull Requests,
so we can't accept your contribution this way.
We instead use a code review system called Gerrit.

The good news is, I'm here to help.

From here, you have two options:

1. Read our [Contribution Guidelines](https://golang.org/doc/contribute.html) to learn how to send a change with Gerrit.
2. Or, [create an issue](https://golang.org/issue/new) about the issue this PR addresses, so that someone else can fix it.

I'm going to close this Pull Request now.
Please don't be offended! :-)

Thanks again,

854222,IssueCommentEvent,"Aaaand this repo is now preserved! 🙌🏽 

Thanks to everyone who chimed in 🌟 , I'm closing the issue now."
854222,IssueCommentEvent,LGTM! 🚀
854222,IssueCommentEvent,"Hello @lyuts, if you check [here](https://github.com/benmills/vimux/blob/master/plugin/vimux.vim#L148-L151) you'll see that the `_VimuxTmux` function is doing exactly this.

It uses `_VimuxOption` to check for the global `g:VimuxTmuxCommand` and if it's not set, fallbacks to just `tmux`.

The check, however, is a good addition! So maybe we can extract the command with fallback and reuse it for the check? Something like:

```vim
if !executable(_VimuxTmuxCmd())
  "" blow up with a useful error message
  finish
endif

"" ....

function! _VimuxTmuxCmd()
  return _VimuxOption(""g:VimuxTmuxCommand"", ""tmux"")
endfunction
```"
854222,IssueCommentEvent,Closing this question as it was answered by @english.
854222,IssueCommentEvent,"Absolutely! I see a few there: Applicative, Functor, Monad, BiFunctor, Foldable.

It’d be nice to make the “correct” choice but let’s try to be pragmatic. We shouldn’t need to be versed in Category Theory to implement standardized interfaces.

I’d propose we at least implement Monad (which includes Functor and Applicative) and consider throwing in:

* Foldable — to collapse so many switches around Result/Optional, and make sure Streams and Futures always resolve to a value
* and Alternative — to provide the common `orElse` / `<|>`."

"
854222,IssueCommentEvent,@michallepicki keep an eye open for this one: https://github.com/AbstractMachinesLab/caramel/actions/runs/282255225 -- the gnu binary should be built against glibc 2.27 🚀 
854222,IssueCommentEvent,"Oops! Apparently the word ""fix"" closes the issue 😅 "
854222,IssueCommentEvent,"@seanhinde yup! getting there 🚀 

The latest head should produce the following `process.erl`, which for me compiles without warnings on Erlang 23. Could you try on a clean build and see if you get the same file?

```erlang
% Source code generated with Caramel.
-module(process).
-export_type([after_time/0]).
-export_type([recv/1]).

-export([contramap/2]).
-export([make/1]).
-export([recv/1]).
-export([send/2]).

-type after_time() :: infinity
                    | {bounded, integer()}
                    .

-type recv(M) :: fun((after_time()) -> option:t(M)).

-spec recv(after_time()) -> option:t(any()).
recv(Timeout) ->
  F = fun (T) -> receive X -> {some, X} after T -> none end end,
  case Timeout of
    infinity -> F(infinity);
    {bounded, T} -> F(T)
  end.

-spec make(fun((erlang:pid(), recv(_m)) -> _a)) -> erlang:pid().
make(F) -> erlang:spawn(fun
  () ->
  Pid = erlang:self(),
  F(Pid, fun recv/1)
end).

-spec send(erlang:pid(), _m) -> ok.
send(Proc, Msg) -> erlang:send(Proc, Msg).

-spec contramap(fun((_b) -> _a), erlang:pid()) -> erlang:pid().
contramap(F, Pid) -> make(fun
  (_self, Recv) ->
  case Recv(infinity) of
    {some, A} -> send(Pid, F(A));
    none -> ok
  end
end).
```

For 2) could you try using the full path? `Beam.Io.format`? The `Beam` module is opened by default, but otherwise should still be available."
854222,IssueCommentEvent,"## Checklist

To make it easier to keep track of what's what and where we currently are, here's a list of the features that are currently working and missing. Where necessary I'll try to make separate issues and link them here.

### Idioms

- [X] Empty tuple `()` is a common value in OCaml, this is translated to the atom `ok` in Erlang. This is not _entirely_ idiomatic, since some functions  are generated that take for last argument the atom `ok`, but it is much nicer for the returned values.

- [x] OCaml let rec's inside of a module-level function definition should be reported as errors. It is common in OCaml to define a recursive helper function to traverse a value using a default accumulator that is hidden from the user, but we can ask the programmer to move this outside for now. See #13 

- [x] OCaml allows `'` (prime) to be used as part of variable names, so it's not uncommon to see `x` and `x'` and `x''`. The equivalent Erlang would be `X`, `X1`, and `X2`, primarily because the single quote is not a valid character to have in a name. See #15

- [x] OCaml allows shadowing of names, which is not supported in Erlang. so that `let x = 1 in let x = x + 1 in x` yields 2. The equivalent Erlang would crash. See #16

### Module System

The goal here is to support the basic OCaml module system, with its nesting and aliasing to provide a flexible and safe way of structuring large amounts of code. Module interfaces should be allowed to dictate what is exported and what isn't.

- [x] **Modules definitions** -- we treat files as modules, and we can create nested modules. Nested modules will be flattened out into separate Erlang modules namespacing the module names. Modules without exports should generate no Erlang sources.

- [x] **Module interfaces** -- interface files will be respected and anything that is not exported there will not be exported in the generated Erlang source. This applies to both types and functions.

- [X] **Module Declarations** -- only functions will be allowed at the module level. Defining values should be an compilation error.

### Type Language

These are the features of the type-language that I'm aiming to support and compile to Dialyzer specs.

- [x] Type variables
- [x] Phantom types -- should be turned into an unused type-variable that will be properly named with an underscore.
- [x] Variants -- compiled into `constructor_atom` or `{constructor_atom, arg0, arg1,...}`
- [x] Polymorphic Variants
  - [x] Explicit constructors -- compiled into `constructor_atom` or `{constructor_atom, arg0, arg1,...}`
  - [x] Inherited constructors
- [x] Tuples
- [x] Aliases
- [x] Records
- [x] Function types
- [x] Interface files constrain exports of types

### Expressions

The following expressions will be supported on the OCaml side 

- [x] Constant:
  - [x] Integers
  - [x] Characters
  - [x] String -- compiled to Erlang Binary strings
  - [x] Floats
- [x] Values
  - [x] Records -- compiled to Erlang maps
    - [x] Creation
    - [X] Field access
    - [ ] Update
  - [x] Lists
    - [x] empty list
    - [x] list prepending / consing
  - [x] Tuples
  - [x] Variant constructors -- compiled to tagged tuples with constructor name as atom tag
  - [x] Polymorphic variant
    - [x] constructor without argumetns -- compiled to atom 
    - [x] constructors with arguments -- compiled to tagged tuples with constructor name as atom tag
  - [x] Fun/Function -- compiled to Erlang fun's
- [x] Let Bindings
- [x] Identifiers
  - [x] Make sure all variable names translate to valid Erlang variable names (#15 #16)
- [ ] Functions
  - [x] References -- in Erlang there is a difference between passing `F` as a parameter, and passing a reference to a function. Waiting on #10   
  - [x] Local calls (in scope or in module scope)
  - [x] Qualified calls 
  - [ ] Lambda calls -- currently this prints `f(A, B)` for `f(A)(B)` since it has no way of knowing that `f` has arity 1.
- [x] Match expressions
  - [ ] Support for grouping cases together (`match x with | 1 | 2 -> true`) -- #9 
- [x] If Expressions -- compiled to case expressions
- [x] Sequencing -- compiled to nested let-bindings with an ignore pattern
- [ ] Guards -- any guard expression should work on any pattern match case, except at the function clause level where only guards that compile to BEAM NIFs should be allowed.

### Patterns

These are the patterns that we can use on the left side of match branches and function headers.

- [x] Ignore value
- [x] Binding to variables
- [x] Tuple
- [x] List
- [x] Records
- [x] Variants
- [x] Polymorphic variants 
- [x] Exact match

### Foreign Interfaces

- [x] Support for `external`
  - [x] without a name override
  - [x] with name overrides"

# Team's Response
We identify customers via phone numbers and email addresses because customers can have the same name which is a common occurrence in our life.
Responding to your ""couple"" example, couples can either utilize a single shared account or just use their own email addresses and phone numbers. It is not difficult to create a new email address.

Sorry I don't understand what you said.
Currently I support the following commands:
        
- `@bot-gradle test {BuildStage}` to trigger a build
  - e.g. `@bot-gradle test SanityCheck plz`
  - `SanityCheck`/`CompileAll`/`QuickFeedbackLinux`/`QuickFeedback`/`ReadyForMerge`/`ReadyForNightly`/`ReadyForRelease` are supported
  - `test this` means `test ReadyForMerge`
  - `SanityCheck` can be abbreviated as `SC`, `ReadyForMerge` as `RFM`, etc.
  - Specific builds:
    - `AST`: `AllSmokeTestsReadyForMerge`
    - `AFT`: `AllFunctionalTestsReadyForMerge`
    - `ASB`: `AllSpecificBuildsReadyForMerge`
    - `ACT`: `AllCrossVersionTestsReadyForNightly`
    - `APTN`: `AllPerformanceTestsReadyForNightly`
    - `AFTN`: `AllFunctionalTestsReadyForNightly`
    - `ACTR`: `AllCrossVersionTestsReadyForRelease`
    - `AFTR`: `AllFunctionalTestsReadyForRelease`
- `@bot-gradle help` to display this message
- `@bot-gradle clean` to clear the conversation history

### Not a bug

2. Add notes to indicate why it is not a bug

### Duplicate bug

1. Add the 'type/duplicate' label
2. Add the link to the original bug

### Bug

Note: Make Sure that 'component', and 'severity' labels are added
Example for how to fill out the template: https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/20100

#### 1. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) (optional) 
<!-- Write down the reason why this bug occurs -->

#### 2. Symptom (optional)

<!-- What will the user see when this bug occurs. The error message may be in the terminal, log or monitoring -->

#### 3. All Trigger Conditions (optional)

<!-- All the user scenarios that may trigger this bug -->

#### 4. Workaround (optional)

#### 5. Affected versions

<!--
In the format of [start_version:end_version], multiple version ranges are
accepted. If the bug only affects the unreleased version, please input:
""unreleased"". For example:

Notes:
  1. Do not use any white spaces in '[]'.
  2. The range in '[]' is a closed interval
  3. The version format is `v$Major.$Minor.$Patch`, the $Majoy and $Minor
     number in a version range should be the same. [v3.0.1:v3.1.2] is
     invalid because the $Minor number of the version range is different.

Example 1: [v3.0.1:v3.0.5], [v4.0.1:v4.0.5]
Example 2: unreleased
-->

#### 6. Fixed versions

<!--
The first released version that contains this fix in each minor version. If the bug's affected version has been released, the fixed version should be a detailed version number; If the bug doesn't affect any released version, the fixed version can be ""master"";  

Example 1: v3.0.13, v4.0.5
Example 2: master

do something\n\nclass MyFancyThing(SomeThing):\n    # pylint: disable=arguments-differ\n    def dosomething(self, some, thing, fancy=None):\n         # do something fancy\n```\n\nFull list with all codes is available at http://pylint-messages.wikidot.com/all-codes\n', 'tests_require': [], 'package_dir': {'': 'lib'}, 'author': 'Stijn De Weirdt;Andy Georges;Jens Timmerman', 'author_email': 'stijn.deweirdt@ugent.be;andy.georges@ugent.be;jens.timmerman@ugent.be', 'download_url': '', 'version': '0.10.26', 'description': ""vsc-install provides shared setuptools functions and classes for python libraries developed by UGent's HPC group"", 'namespace_packages': ['vsc'], 'scripts': ['bin/python-stripped-env', 'bin/python-noenv.sh'], 'command_packages': ['vsc.install.shared_setup', 'shared_setup_dist_only', 'setuptools.command', 'distutils.command'], 'packages': ['vsc.install', 'vsc'], 'classifiers': ['License :: OSI Approved :: GNU Lesser General Public License v2 or later (LGPLv2+)'], 'dependency_links': [], 'name': 'vsc-install', 'license': 'LGPLv2+', 'url': 'https://github.com/hpcugent/vsc-install', 'cmdclass': {'bdist_rpm': <class __main__.vsc_bdist_rpm at 0x28544d0>, 'install_scripts': <class __main__.vsc_install_scripts at 0x28549b0>, 'egg_info': <class __main__.vsc_egg_info at 0x2854a70>, 'test': <class __main__.VscTestCommand at 0x2854770>, 'vsc_release': <class __main__.vsc_release at 0x2854d10>, 'sdist': <class __main__.vsc_sdist at 0x2854b90>}, 'test_suite': 'test'}

There's now a new version of Reachability.h to which most of your suggestions have been applied.

---

> moved the implementation out of the class definition

Done.  Implementations along with longer comments are now at the end of Reachability, grouped according to usage.  Important types for clients and relevant member functions are listed first, followed by implementation details.

> setEndState
> You could comment that this returns true if the state changes.

Done.

> This API actually makes initialization more complex as opposed to just directly calling result.unknownEndBlocks.insert(block);

The `setEndStateForBlock` function is now only used for state transitions, not initialization.

As discussed, there is a separate initializeBeginStateToUnknown.

Both of these are now member functions on IterativeBlockReachability::Result.

The IterativeBackwardReachability::Result class is now solely responsible for dealing with tracking blocks' effects and states.  Reachability itself just gets and sets states and effects for blocks, without concern for how they happen to be stored.

> replace both cases of this pattern

Done.

> ""Optionality"" should be part of the enum state

Done.  IterativeBackwardReachability::Effect now has three cases: `NoEffect`, `Kill`, `Gen`.

> findLocalEffect should simply find the effect of the region of interest

The variants of findLocalEffect have been replaced with: `summarizeLocalEffect(SILBasicBlock *)`, `summarizeLocalEffectBefore(SILInstruction *)`, and `findFirstLocalEffectBefore(SILInstruction *, Effect target)`.  The bodies of the second two are similar.  The version that takes a block composes the effect of the back of the block with the effect before the block.

> It's not clear to me how global data flow can propagate beyond discovered blocks. Should that be an assert?

No--at least notot without other changes.  The point of this continue is to avoid propagating beyond discovered blocks.  Blocks can be added to the worklist even if their predecessors aren't reachable.  Blocks are added to the worklist whenever they're found to be unreachable-at-begin; there is no check that all of its predecessors are reachable.

A block is added to the worklist whenever its unreachable-at-begin.  But its predecessors aren't marked as discovered if the block is a kill or if it's the def block.

> Why can't a gen be reachable? There's no joint-post-dominating gen guarantee.

Fixed.  Removed the assert.

> ""to unreachable-at-end-ness""

Fixed.

> Use an index to avoid iterator invalidation.

Is this a problem for BasicBlockSetVector's iterator aka StackList's iterator?  The iterator looks to be a wrapper around an index and the slab being indexed into.  Can that be invalidated by growing the StackList?  If it is, BasicBlockSetVector doesn't seem to support accessing elements by index.

>  package that up as struct Barriers

The findBarriers member function now takes a visitor whose three member functions are called to visit barrier instructions, blocks, and phis.

> We need to define ""barrier block"" somewhere. It's non-obviuos.

Done.  In the doc for findBarriers."

The team considers three options: building support into the UI, providing support through a third-party service, or supporting raw queries in PostHog. There are concerns around technical complexities, security, and performance. While the team sees the value in this feature, it's decided to table it for now and instead suggest customers use their data warehouses or integrate third-party tools like Metabase."

I suppose we'd need the following to give it more context:
```
Type link
Java element signature (?)

Javadoc

Classpath Entry container

Not sure if we could get those delimiters done nicely as they are shown in IntelliJ.

I can see this being fixed in the old properties editor that we use in STS3 and partly in STS4, but I don't see the nice hover information in the language-server-based property editor when using that in Eclipse/STS4 distro. Can you double check?"

133832,IssueCommentEvent,Sorry for the late answer. Thanks a lot! That's awesome.
133832,IssueCommentEvent,Ops you wanted to keep the issue open :D sorry
133832,IssueCommentEvent,"Nice find! 
The problem I ran into when parsing the whole cassette was indeed blowing the memory_limit. The ideas was to limit the memory usage to the size of one request/response pair. Reading the whole line instead of each char makes a lot of sense. 
"
133832,IssueCommentEvent,@jderusse Done! Do you know why the phpcs job fails?
133832,IssueCommentEvent,"Thanks! Did all the changes 👍

133832,IssueCommentEvent,Thank you for the patience and feedback :) 
133832,IssueCommentEvent,"Please hold a release :) 
In production the `newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($headers);` call doesn't work. I assume it's because the `$header` needs to be passed as a reference. Will make a PR to fix it."
133832,IssueCommentEvent,Friendly ping :)
133832,IssueCommentEvent,Thanks for fixing this so quickly! :)
133832,IssueCommentEvent,Awesome! Thanks a lot @vladar :)

133832,IssueCommentEvent,"I'm not sure if it's related, but before the segmentation violation there are sometimes timeouts.
The skipper instance runs in Kubernetes where the memory usage keeps rising over time. I also see sometimes out of memory kills (OOM). There might be a memory leak somewhere. I did not profile it yet, hope to get to it next week.

133832,IssueCommentEvent,Sorry I just found the related ticket #617. I'm closing this in favour of that one.
133832,IssueCommentEvent,"Hi! Thank you, I’m sorry for my confusion. "
133832,IssueCommentEvent,"Yes you are right, good point. We could move the content of the if above and then check the response. 
This a nice side effect: Because `hasRequest` calls `playback`, `playback` is actually called twice which should be changed for a speedup like shown in #93. 

How do you like something like this?

```
$this->dispatch(VCREvents::VCR_BEFORE_PLAYBACK, new BeforePlaybackEvent($request, $this->cassette));
$response = $this->cassette->playback($request); // or getRequest()
$this->dispatch(VCREvents::VCR_AFTER_PLAYBACK, new AfterPlaybackEvent($request, $response, $this->cassette));

if ($response) {
   return $response;

48335577,IssueCommentEvent,"Hi @dependabot[bot]. Thanks for your PR.

I'm waiting for a [tektoncd](https://github.com/orgs/tektoncd/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://github.com/orgs/tektoncd/people) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

### Description

I would love a better handling of nested configs during sweeping. Specifically, I would like to be able to provide a default config in `wandb.init(config=defaults)` whose parameters are only update by the sweep config.
This is an example sweep configuration (in Jupyter):
`sweep_configuration = {
    'method': 'bayes',
    'metric': {
        'goal': 'minimize', 
        'name': 'valid/best_loss'
    },
    'parameters': {
        'model': {
            'parameters': {
                'cgnn': {
                    'parameters': {
                        'train': {
                            'parameters': {
                                'batch_s': {'values': [4, 8, 16]},
                                'lr': {'max': 0.1, 'min': 0.0001}
                            }
                        },
                        'model': {
                            'parameters': {
                                'num_layers': {'values': [2, 4, 6]},
                                'head_num': {'values': [4, 8, 16]},
                                'embed_dim': {'values': [64, 128]},
                                'ff_hidden_dim': {'values': [256, 512]},
                                'softmax': {'values': [True, False]},
                                'extra_out': {'values': [True, False]},
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}`
If there is a better way to define a nested sweep config let me know. A solution could massively reduce overhead when setting up a sweep config.

### Suggested Solution

When providing a nested default config in `wandb.init(config=defaults)` the config provided by the sweep should preserve the original nested structure of the default config when adding/overwriting values. 
For the above sweep configuration, this would mean the `wandb.config` would also contain additional training parameters like weight decay etc.
I think a solution should just do a recursive config merge.

It appears that one or more of your feedstock's outputs did not copy from the
staging channel (cf-staging) to the production channel (conda-forge). :(

This failure can happen for a lot of reasons, including an outdated feedstock
token. Below we have put some information about the failure to help you debug it.

**Rerendering the feedstock will usually fix these problems.**

50545563,IssueCommentEvent,"Hi! 👋

This issue looks stale, and doesn't feature the `reproducible` label - which implies that you didn't provide a working reproduction using [Sherlock](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/sherlock). As a result, it'll be closed in a few days unless a maintainer explicitly vouches for it or you edit your first post to include a formal reproduction (you can use the [playground](http://yarnpkg.com/playground) for that).

Note that we require Sherlock reproductions for long-lived issues (rather than standalone git repositories or similar) because we're a small team. Sherlock gives us the ability to check which bugs are still affecting the master branch at any given point, and decreases the amount of code we need to run on our own machines (thus leading to faster bug resolutions). It helps us help you! 😃

If you absolutely *cannot* reproduce a bug on Sherlock (for example because it's a Windows-only issue), a maintainer will have to manually add the `upholded` label. Thanks for helping us triaging our repository! 🌟"

I have created folder, 'BPagano-RtDriven' containing '2020-10-04-BPagano-RtDriven.csv' and 'metadata-BPagano_RtDriven.txt' in
'rjpagano/covid19-forecast-hub/data-processed'

Do I issue another pull request to relocate this folder to
'https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub' https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub ?

I would appreciate you guidance.

Thank you,

> Could you also add README.md file with instructions how to use these scripts, please?

Yes, the script is not suitable for Windows. For Windows, new builders will be created on Buildbot, and *.bat files could be added for new builders.  

I think the purpose of these scripts is for developers to do customize the build command for the builders on Buildbot. So I think it's reasonable to seperate Windows scripts with these scripts, the command may be different and seperate script could keep things simple.

OK, I will add README for it."

However\, current fix will not allow such JDK build\, since we checking for presence of \?bin\? folder and not if ID is actually unique\. To work around this limitation user can package without native commands first\, then add native commands and re\-sign application\.

There is no a way to do the signing of standalone app image and app image will not get signed if you generating DMG or PKG by providing app image via \?app\-image and specifing signing\. Only PKG will get signed if signing is specified with \?app\-image\.

Currently jpackage will block following command\:
jpackage \-\-type app\-image \-\-app\-image Test\.app \-\-mac\-sign \.\.\.
Error\: Option \[\-\-app\-image\] is not valid with type \[app\-image\]

I think we can allow app\-image type with app image input if signing is requested and command from above will just sign app image in place\.

Generating DMG or PKG from \?app\-image and with signing enabled will not sign app image as it currently do\.

If no objections for proposed enhancement I will go ahead and file one\.

Thanks\,

Thanks for submitting your package. We are taking a quick
look at it and you will hear back from us soon.

The DESCRIPTION file for this package is:

```
Package: CytoMDS
Title: Low Dimensions projection of cytometry samples
Version: 0.99.8
Authors@R:
    c(person(given = ""Philippe"",
   family = ""Hauchamps"",
   role = c(""aut"", ""cre""),
   email = ""philippe.hauchamps@uclouvain.be"",

   email = ""dan.8.lin@gsk.com""))
Description: This package implements a low dimensional visualization of a set
 of cytometry samples, in order to visually assess the 'distances' between them.
 This, in turn, can greatly help the user to identify quality issues 
 like batch effects or outlier samples, and/or check the presence of potential 
 sample clusters that might align with the exeprimental design.  
 The CytoMDS algorithm combines, on the one hand, the concept of Earth Mover's 
 Distance (EMD), a.k.a. Wasserstein metric and, on the other hand, 
 the Multi Dimensional Scaling (MDS) algorithm for the low dimensional
 projection.  
 Also, the package provides some diagnostic tools for both checking the quality 
 of the MDS projection, as well as tools to help with the interpretation of 
 the axes of the projection.

Inspecting the JavaScript source for this package found some properties that are not in the .d.ts files.
The check for missing properties isn't always right, so take this list as advice, not a requirement.
## video.js ([<kbd>unpkg</kbd>](https://unpkg.com/browse/video.js@latest/))
was missing the following properties:
1. The declaration doesn't match the JavaScript module 'video.js'. Reason:
The JavaScript module can be called or constructed, but the declaration module cannot.

The most common way to resolve this error is to use 'export =' syntax.
To learn more about 'export =' syntax, see https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html#export--and-import--require.

"
59518230,IssueCommentEvent,"Congratulations on your first Pull Request and welcome to the Apache Airflow community! If you have any issues or are unsure about any anything please check our Contributors' Guide (https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/README.rst)
Here are some useful points:
- Pay attention to the quality of your code (ruff, mypy and type annotations). Our [pre-commits]( https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/08_static_code_checks.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks) will help you with that.
- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory). Adding a new operator? Check this short [guide](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/docs/apache-airflow/howto/custom-operator.rst) Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.
- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/dev/breeze/doc/README.rst) for testing locally, it's a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.

I'm not sure what you mean. The URL is correct:
http://lists.pcbsd.org/mailman/listinfo/testing

Also, the ""testing@lists.pcbsd.org"" address works also (you do have to

24485218,IssueCommentEvent,"Owee, I'm MrMeeseeks, Look at me.

There seem to be a conflict, please backport manually. Here are approximate instructions:

1. Checkout backport branch and update it.

```
git checkout 1.5.x
git pull
```

2. Cherry pick the first parent branch of the this PR on top of the older branch:
```
git cherry-pick -x -m1 0106c26529900bad0561efb9c9180f7f016365b0
```

3. You will likely have some merge/cherry-pick conflict here, fix them and commit:

```
git commit -am 'Backport PR #49053: REVERT caching in find_stack_level'
```

4. Push to a named branch:

```
git push YOURFORK 1.5.x:auto-backport-of-pr-49053-on-1.5.x
```

5. Create a PR against branch 1.5.x, I would have named this PR:

> ""Backport PR #49053 on branch 1.5.x (REVERT caching in find_stack_level)""

And apply the correct labels and milestones.

Congratulations — you did some good work! Hopefully your backport PR will be tested by the continuous integration and merged soon!

Remember to remove the `Still Needs Manual Backport` label once the PR gets merged.

If these instructions are inaccurate, feel free to [suggest an improvement](https://github.com/MeeseeksBox/MeeseeksDev).

615952,IssueCommentEvent,"So I think I've found the problem, Kitematic is an Electron app, and there is an issue with the CSS.

This is an issue with other electron apps where the overflow is set to hidden, which this is. I've seen this in the source code.
Only thing is I'm not sure how to build an Electron app from the source code (yet).

For those fixing this, I'd start with changing /styles/container-home.less:
  overflow: hidden;

to 
  overflow: auto;

Hope this helps someone.

For QA, it can be tested (making sure you have the homepage settings as described in the comments here):

  * Leaving to background, when the settings page is dismissed then the settings can be seen again
  * Also make sure that anytime we show the settings and dismiss the page, it’s possible to see the settings page again from the hamburger menu. Here’s some places we can dismiss the settings page:
    * Swiping the settings page away on iPhone
    * From the “done” button
    * From the wallpaper settings page when clicking on the “see wallpaper“ blue banner
    * Any other places you think of"

<summary>Bors help and documentation</summary>
<br />

Bors is a Github App used to manage merging of PRs in order to ensure that CI is always green. It does so by maintaining a [Merge Queue](https://github.com/diem/diem/projects/2). Once a PR reaches the head of the Merge Queue it is rebased on top of the latest version of the PR's `base-branch` (generally `master`) and then triggers CI. If CI comes back green the PR is then merged into the `base-branch`. Regardless of the outcome, the next PR is the queue is then processed.

### General
- This project's Merge Queue can be found [here](https://github.com/diem/diem/projects/2).
- This project requires PRs to be [Reviewed](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews) and Approved before they can be queued for merging.
- Before PR's can be merged they must be configured with [""Allow edits from maintainers""](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) enabled. This is needed for Bors to be able to update PR's in-place so that Github can properly recognize and mark them as ""merged"" once they've been merged into the upstream branch.
### Commands
Bors actions can be triggered by posting a comment which includes a line of the form `/<action>`.
| Command | Action | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| __Land__ | `land`, `merge` | attempt to land or merge a PR |
| __Canary__ | `canary`, `try` | canary a PR by performing all checks without merging |
| __Cancel__ | `cancel`, `stop` | stop an in-progress land |
| __Cherry Pick__ | `cherry-pick <target>` | cherry-pick a PR into `<target>` branch |
| __Priority__ | `priority` | set the priority level for a PR (`high`, `normal`, `low`) |
| __Help__ | `help`, `h` | show this help message |

### Options
Options for Pull Requests are configured through the application of labels.
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Option&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ![label: bors-high-priority](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=bors-high-priority&color=lightgrey) | Indicates that the PR is high-priority. When queued the PR will be placed at the head of the merge queue. |
| ![label: bors-low-priority](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=bors-low-priority&color=lightgrey) | Indicates that the PR is low-priority. When queued the PR will be placed at the back of the merge queue. |
| ![label: bors-squash](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=bors-squash&color=lightgrey) | Before merging the PR will be squashed down to a single commit, only retaining the commit message of the first commit in the PR. |

## New packages
This Pull Request appears to be introducing new packages only. Due to limited manpower, adding new packages is considered low priority. This does not mean that your Pull Request will not receive any attention, however, it might take quite some time for it to be reviewed. In the meantime, your new ebuild might find a home in the [GURU project repository](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:GURU): the ebuild repository maintained collaboratively by Gentoo users. GURU offers your ebuild a place to be reviewed and improved by other Gentoo users, while making it easy for Gentoo users to install it and enjoy the software it adds.

2932368,IssueCommentEvent,"Hello @valeros,

Same behaviour with v9.3.1 toolchain package.

Build is fine, upload is fine using a JLINK probe, but program goes to MBED blink error sequence as soon as it is uploaded.
The only solution is to plug/unplug the board to get the program running. And, of course, debug can't work on theses conditions.

After enabling serial output, I managed to get this MBED error fault message:

It seems to be kind of related to this MBED issue: https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/issues/10339

But in my case, I am just trying to build the [official MBED blinky](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-example-blinky/blob/master/main.cpp).

Another possible explanation: I am using a custom board with a STM32G474VE. But I have verified multiple times the custom targets MBED files, and all seems good (only two files in my case, `PeripheralPins.c`, and `PinNames.h`).

If I switch to MBED 5.15.6 PIO package (and after copy/past all STM32G4 target files introduce from MBED 6), then the problem disappears.

Unfortunately, I don't have an official board from ST (a nucleo with a STM32G4) to verify if the problem comes from my board in particular. I don't have this problem with other board that use different brands of STM32.

The issue does not appear if I am using DFU as `upload_protocol`. Only appear with a JLINK probe.

The issue does not appear with MBED-CLI 1, using gcc-arm-none-eabi 9-2019-q4-major [as precise here](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v6.6/build-tools/index.html#compiler-versions).

What I can't figure it out is why (and how) the toolchain version is affecting the STM32G4 family with a MBED 6 program when using JLINK probes ... I first open the issue here, because I thought it was a toolchain version error from the PlatformIO package, but maybe this is a deeper issue that comes from MBED side.

This maybe need further investigating on my part (using at least a nucleo board), to pinpoint precisely the problem.
"
2932368,IssueCommentEvent,"Update:
Adding the missing flags from MBED debug profile file unlock the use of ""-Og"" flag into PlatformIO:

```
build_type = debug
debug_build_flags = -Og -DMBED_DEBUG -DMBED_TRAP_ERRORS_ENABLED=1 -g2 -ggdb2
```

Maybe the ""-DMBED_DEBUG"" should be add by default in PIO when MBED framework is used ?"
2932368,IssueCommentEvent,It works like a charm ! Thank you very much !
2932368,IssueCommentEvent,"Work on my side with a PHANTOM Premium 1.5 / 6D0F (parallel port). 
But I had to make sure that ""Pinch Capable"" was set in PHANToMConfiguration, I couldn't detect the pushbuton if it was not set."
2932368,IssueCommentEvent,"Hello,

A pull request is already open to fix this issue: #14032 "
2932368,IssueCommentEvent,"Hi again, 

First thanks you for the PR ! I just switch to the dev version of PIO (4.3.2a2) and re-init my project and ... it doesn't work completely for me haha

It works fine for the first environment, but not the second. It seems that the `CMakeListsPrivate.txt` does the glob_recurse only for the first env but not the others.

Using the same `test_folder.zip` project above, I edit the end of the new  generated `CMakeListsPrivate.txt`  like this to make it `lib_extra_dirs` ""environment dependent"" when calling `FILE (GLOB_RECURSE ...)` :

```
...

FILE(GLOB_RECURSE SRC_LIST
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/src/*.*
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/lib/*.*
)

if (CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE MATCHES ""test_boardone"")
    FILE(GLOB_RECURSE SRC_LIST_test_boardone
        ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/ext_lib/boardOne/*.*
        ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/.pio/libdeps/test_boardone/*.*
    )
    SET(SRC_LIST ${SRC_LIST} ${SRC_LIST_test_boardone})
endif()
if (CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE MATCHES ""test_boardtwo"")
    FILE(GLOB_RECURSE SRC_LIST_test_boardtwo
        ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/ext_lib/boardTwo/*.*
        ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/.pio/libdeps/test_boardtwo/*.*
    )
    SET(SRC_LIST ${SRC_LIST} ${SRC_LIST_test_boardtwo})
endif()
```

I don't know very well Cmake so I don't know if it is a viable solution or not, but it seems to work for Clion."
2932368,IssueCommentEvent,"Clion complains for the .cpp file of the lib (not the header) :
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2932368/79898550-b38b9f00-840b-11ea-8ecd-89c3338c0d63.png)

This occurs only if the 'lib_extra_dirs' is not the same as the first environment.

2932368,IssueCommentEvent,"Hi @MasterLufier 

Are you using the latest PIO MBED package (6.6.0) ? 
There is a known bug with STLINK / JLINK probe since MBED 6.6.0, [does this fix could help you](https://community.platformio.org/t/mbed-6-6-0-upload-debug-issues-with-j-link-or-st-link/18444) ?"

This doesn't seem correct. `tearDown` should always be called, so if `tearDown` calls `stop`, it should be called unless something fails *during teardown*.

If tearDown was skipped on test failure, we'd be in deep shit."

I recommend you give this issue a high priority, so other packages depending on you can benefit from your bug fixes and new features again.

You can find below the list of errors reported by **semantic-release**. Each one of them has to be resolved in order to automatically publish your package. I’m sure you can fix this 💪.

Errors are usually caused by a misconfiguration or an authentication problem. With each error reported below you will find explanation and guidance to help you to resolve it.

Once all the errors are resolved, **semantic-release** will release your package the next time you push a commit to the `master` branch. You can also manually restart the failed CI job that runs **semantic-release**.

If you are not sure how to resolve this, here are some links that can help you:
- [Usage documentation](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/caribou/docs/usage/README.md)
- [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/caribou/docs/support/FAQ.md)
- [Support channels](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#get-help)

If those don’t help, or if this issue is reporting something you think isn’t right, you can always ask the humans behind **[semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/issues/new)**.

### Invalid npm token.

The [npm token](https://github.com/semantic-release/npm/blob/master/README.md#npm-registry-authentication) configured in the `NPM_TOKEN` environment variable must be a valid [token](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/working_with_tokens) allowing to publish to the registry `https://registry.npmjs.org/`.

If you are using Two Factor Authentication for your account, set its level to [""Authorization only""](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-two-factor-authentication#levels-of-authentication) in your account settings. **semantic-release** cannot publish with the default ""
Authorization and writes"" level.

Please make sure to set the `NPM_TOKEN` environment variable in your CI with the exact value of the npm token.

## Tree Components Missing Full Expand and Collapse Features

@jhsu @pmq20 @luolonghao
-hsu - [] I have searched the [issues](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues) of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

### What problem does this feature solve?
This is a common function of Tree

### What does the proposed API look like?
<Radio.Group size=""default"" onChange={this.handleExpandChange}>
                      <Radio.Button value=""ALL"">Expand All</Radio.Button>
                      <Radio.Button value=""PACKUP"">All Collapse</Radio.Button>

  load: (name: string) => Promise.resolve(),
  iframes: {
    getContext: () => {
      return {

- Active
- Active_And_Hidden
- Inactive

My use case is I'm tracking session time, and when the user opens the in app browser it fires an app state change event for INACTIVE (on android only). I have no way of telling whether the user left the app, or just opened the in app browser."

Thank you for submitting your feature request! Looks like during the polling process it didn't collect a sufficient number of votes to move to the next stage.

We want to keep Angular rich and ergonomic and at the same time be mindful about its scope and learning journey. If you think your request could live outside Angular's scope, we'd encourage you to collaborate with the [community](https://angular.io/resources?category=community) on publishing it as an open source [package](https://angular.io/guide/creating-libraries).

You can find more details about the feature request process in our [documentation](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/e29eb8abfbfdfb793e08ac88e14b7ba6d2ff2136/docs/GITHUB_PROCESS.md#feature-request-process)."

This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least two months.

The resources of the Jekyll team are limited, and so we are asking for your help.

If this is a **bug** and you can still reproduce this error on the <code>3.3-stable</code> or <code>master</code> branch, please reply with all of the information you have about it in order to keep the issue open.

If this is a **feature request**, please consider building it first as a plugin. Jekyll 3 introduced [hooks](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/#hooks) which provide convenient access points throughout the Jekyll build pipeline whereby most needs can be fulfilled. If this is something that cannot be built as a plugin, then please provide more information about why in order to keep this issue open.

This issue will automatically be closed in two months if no further activity occurs. Thank you for all your contributions.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority, so other packages depending on you could benefit from your bug fixes and new features.

You can find below the list of errors reported by **semantic-release**. Each one of them has to be resolved in order to automatically publish your package. I’m sure you can resolve this 💪.

Errors are usually caused by a misconfiguration or an authentication problem. With each error reported below you will find explanation and guidance to help you to resolve it.

Once all the errors are resolved, **semantic-release** will release your package the next time you push a commit to the `undefined` branch. You can also manually restart the failed CI job that runs **semantic-release**.

If you are not sure how to resolve this, here is some links that can help you:
- [Usage documentation](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/caribou/docs/usage/README.md)
- [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/caribou/docs/support/FAQ.md)

<p>

Blocked by [PRO-2778](https://linear.app/apostrophecms/issue/PRO-2778/webpack-caching) [PRO-2784](https://linear.app/apostrophecms/issue/PRO-2784/in-development-only-build-process-reuse-single-site)

Once we reach this point, we can speed things up greatly by rebuilding only `apos`, or only `src`, depending on which has changed. **This is only relevant when** **APOS_DEV=1 is present** but it will greatly improve the experience of those developing Apostrophe admin UI.

To achieve this, building on the work in the earlier tickets, the change detection code should be enhanced to make the distinction and specify which build has changed when calling the new build method.

If a `src` build is performed, the `user` bundle still must be reassembled in the usual way by concatenating the two builds, but the actual recompilation of the `apos` code can be skipped.

If `ui/public` has been modified, only the `ui/public` ""build"" (simple concatenation of files) must be repeated, and again both bundles must be reassembled from the builds.

If the es5 build is present it should rebuild whenever `src` does.

***In all of these cases the right thing should be done by examining the name,*** `***source***` ***option (if present), and*** `***scenes***` ***option of the build in question, not by hardcoding it.***

**Acceptance Criteria**

Modifications to `ui/src` or `ui/apos` or `ui/public` code are correctly reflected on the page after an automatic page refresh, without performing more builds than necessary. If only ui/src is touched, then only the `src` and (if enabled) `src-es5` builds are performed, however the apos bundle is still re-concatenated to include the output. If `ui/apos` is touched only the `apos` build is performed. If `ui/public` is touched, no builds are performed (other than the simple concatenation ""build"" of `ui/public`), but all of the output bundles are re-concatenated to include it.

Unit test coverage:

* a change to ui/src should re-concatenate both bundles but only recompile the ui/src portion;
* a change to ui/public should re-concatenate everything but do no webpack builds;
* a change to ui/apos should only rebuild the apos bundle.

None of this is in play if `NODE_ENV` is production.

In order to allow symlinked non-bundle modules we need also:

<p>

Basically what I have in mind is to have a try/catch block around it, and if it fails the first time around (try), make another call to ipfs (catch)

And if finally, after two attempts a connection could not be established fall back to a empty string (not null, or undefined)

This way the colony creation flow will always succeed (unless a blockchain error — but we can't stop that), even if IPFS fails

46292936,IssueCommentEvent,"Hi @YikSanChan. Thanks for your PR.

I'm waiting for a [feast-dev](https://github.com/orgs/feast-dev/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://github.com/orgs/feast-dev/people) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

 * Q: Having looked through the issue on github, along with the clarification provided by @chriseth, I'm confident I can reword the relevant section in contracts.rst to reflect current reality and planned changes. In my experience with developing tutorials and teaching material it is best to *omit* mention of future plans completely and stick only to the current facts. (The docs will naturally have to be upgraded when the software changes, but that's a yagni for now) but please do give guidance on whether you feel the planned upgrade /should/  be discussed or not.

Enough: this note is already longer than the text needed!

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

### Usemos GitHub Pages

¡Ahora, a lo que venimos! GitHub Pages te permite servir un sitio estático basado en un repositorio. Hemos llenado este repositorio con contenido, pero el sitio aún no es visible. Cambiemos eso.

### :keyboard: Actividad: Habilita GitHub Pages

1. Haz clic en la pestaña [**Settings**](https://github.com/Andelir/github-slideshow/settings) de este repositorio
1. Navega a la sección de GitHub Pages
1. En la lista llamada ""Source"" selecciona **master branch**

> Nota: Aunque puedes ver una opción para escoger un tema, no apliques ningún tema en este momento. Hemos protegido el código para que no puedas hacer cambios involuntarios. Tendrás oportunidad de usar un tema cuando terminemos el curso.

37936606,IssueCommentEvent,"### :keyboard: Activity: Apply a downloading function to each state

Awesome, time for your first code changes :pencil2:.

- [ ] Write three targets in *_targets.R* to apply `get_site_data()` to each state in `states` (insert these new targets under the `# TODO: PULL SITE DATA HERE` placeholder in `_targets.R`). The targets should be named `wi_data`, `mn_data`, and `mi_data`. `oldest_active_sites` should be used for the `sites_info` argument in `get_site_data()`.

- [ ] Add a call to `source()` near the top of *_targets.R* as needed to make your pipeline executable.

- [ ] Test it: You should be able to run `tar_make()` with no arguments to get everything built.

:bulb: Hint: the `get_site_data()` function already exists and shouldn't need modification. You can find it by browsing the repo or by hitting **Ctrl-SHIFT-F.** in RStudio and then searching for ""get_site_data"".

When you're satisfied with your code, open a PR to merge the ""three-states"" branch into ""main"". Make sure to add `_targets/*`, `3_visualize/out/*`, and any *.DS_Store* files to your `.gitignore` file before committing anything. In the description box for your PR, include a screenshot or transcript of your console session where the targets get built.

<details>
  <summary><strong>How to read the data</strong></summary>
The tables contain differences in performance which are larger than 8% and
differences in code size which are larger than 1%.

If you see any unexpected regressions, you should consider fixing the
regressions before you merge the PR.

**Noise**: Sometimes the performance results (not code size!) contain false
alarms. Unexpected regressions which are marked with '(?)' are probably noise.
If you see regressions which you cannot explain you can try to run the
benchmarks again. If regressions still show up, please consult with the
performance team (@eeckstein).

As this PR has been closed unmerged, Renovate will now ignore this update (^0.25.0). You will still receive a PR once a newer version is released, so if you wish to permanently ignore this dependency, please add it to the `ignoreDeps` array of your renovate config.

If this PR was closed by mistake or you changed your mind, you can simply rename this PR and you will soon get a fresh replacement PR opened."

Trunk is the only way that you can submit pods to CocoaPods, we do not accept pull requests to the CocoaPods Specs repo, and so this is being auto-closed. Please see #12199 for more info.

- To push a new version to trunk, you can use `pod trunk push`.
- You cannot amend an existing pod, however you can delete and deprecate a pod. You need to be using CocoaPods 1.0 to have access to `pod trunk delete` and `pod trunk deprecate`. People may be relying on your pod version, so use these with caution.
- If you don't have permission to update a pod that you own, please [file a claim](http://blog.cocoapods.org/Claim-Your-Pods/) on trunk.

56610014,IssueCommentEvent,"From the template it looks like you are installing **TensorFlow** (TF) prebuilt binaries:
   * For TF-GPU - See point 1
   * For TF-CPU - See point 2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**1. Installing **TensorFlow-GPU** (TF) prebuilt binaries**

Make sure you are using compatible TF and CUDA versions. Please refer following TF version and CUDA version compatibility table.
| TF  | CUDA |
| :-------------: | :-------------: |
| 2.1.0 - 2.2.0  | 10.1 |
| 1.13.1 - 2.0  | 10.0  |
| 1.5.0 - 1.12.0 | 9.0 |

  * If you have above configuration and using _**Windows**_ platform -
    * Try adding the CUDA, CUPTI, and cuDNN installation directories to the %PATH% environment variable.
    * Refer [windows setup guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu#windows_setup).
  * If you have above configuration and using _**Ubuntu/Linux**_ platform -
    * Try adding the CUDA, CUPTI, and cuDNN installation directories to the $LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
    * Refer [linux setup guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu#linux_setup).
  * If error still persists then, apparently your CPU model does not support AVX instruction sets.
    * Refer [hardware requirements](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#hardware-requirements).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**2. Installing **TensorFlow** (TF) CPU prebuilt binaries**

*TensorFlow release binaries version 1.6 and higher are prebuilt with AVX instruction sets.*

Therefore on any CPU that does not have these instruction sets, either CPU or GPU version of TF will fail to load.
Apparently, your CPU model does not support AVX instruction sets. You can still use TensorFlow with the alternatives given below:

   * Try Google Colab to use TensorFlow.
      * The easiest way to use TF will be to switch to [google colab](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true). You get pre-installed latest stable TF version. Also you can use ```pip install```  to install any other preferred TF version.
      * It has an added advantage since you can you easily switch to different hardware accelerators (cpu, gpu, tpu) as per the task.
      * All you need is a good internet connection and you are all set.
   * Try to build TF from sources by changing CPU optimization flags.

*Please let us know if this helps.*

### Element UI version

### Steps to reproduce
Sorry, because the codesandbox link cannot be used in the replay link, the real replay link is here:

Preview page:

https://rvmb7.csb.app/
Recurring reference link index.html  How to write it.

Vue is introduced by CDN, and element UI is compiled by webpack.
The in El table cannot be displayed normally. The displayed html is as follows:

` ` ` `
<div id=""app"">

table:
<div class=""el-table el-table--fit el-table--enable-row-hover el-table--enable-row-transition"" style=""width: 100%;""><div class=""hidden-columns""><div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div class=""el-table__ header-wrapper""><table cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" border=""0"" class=""el-table__ header"" style=""width: 1369px;""><colgroup></colgroup><thead class=""""><tr class=""""></tr></thead></table></div><div class=""el-table__ body-wrapper is-scrolling-none""><table cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" border=""0"" class=""el-table__ body"" style=""width: 1369px;""><colgroup></colgroup><tbody><tr class=""el-table__ row""></tr><tr class=""el-table__ row""></tr><tr class=""el-table__ row""></tr><tr class=""el-table__ row""></tr><!----></tbody></table><!----><!----></div><!----><!----><!----><!----><div class=""el-table__ column-resize-proxy"" style=""display: none;"">

</div>
</div>

</div>
` ` ` `

This situation is common in projects that do not fully use webpack to develop the front-end, such as rails projects, or projects under previous maintenance.
In the transition to pure front-end, these projects will introduce the compiled webpack code into the original HTML page and coexist with the original old code. Then this happens. The El table cannot display normally.

For the same code, there is no problem in using CDN or webpack in Vue element UI.

👋 **Hi there!** I’ve run some quick measurements against master and your PR. These metrics should help the humans reviewing this PR gauge whether it might negatively affect compile times or editor responsiveness for users who install these typings.


Let’s review the numbers, shall we?

These typings are for a package that doesn’t yet exist on master, so I don’t have anything to compare against yet! In the future, I’ll be able to compare PRs to react-country-flag with its source on master.

30785616,IssueCommentEvent,"@joggingsong, even though it's a late response, let me give you some hints.
1) The noise might be reduced when you use longer exposure times. I suggest you using triple exposure time mode, you won't need to set any exposure time. It's like HDR with exposure bracketing.
2) Use a temporal filter or a lateral filter (e.g. bilateral filter)
3) when this is your main target and distance, better use the O3D300, it has a 40° opening angle, thus more details can be seen on smaller objects (like using a telelense). Pixel-size in 2m (with 100k resolution) using 60°: 7x7mm, using 40°: 4x4mm."

47586280,IssueCommentEvent,"Hi @chavacava. Thanks for your PR.

I'm waiting for a [kubesphere](https://github.com/orgs/kubesphere/people) member to verify that this patch is reasonable to test. If it is, they should reply with `/ok-to-test` on its own line. Until that is done, I will not automatically test new commits in this PR, but the usual testing commands by org members will still work. Regular contributors should [join the org](https://github.com/orgs/kubesphere/people) to skip this step.

Once the patch is verified, the new status will be reflected by the `ok-to-test` label.

I understand the commands that are listed [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands?repo=kubesphere%2Fkubesphere).

86582215,IssueCommentEvent,"Hi @Andrew-Dunning-NNL! I noticed that the following package(s) don't yet have maintainers:

* rdma-core

Are you interested in adopting any of these package(s)? If so, simply add the following to the package class:
```python
    maintainers = [""Andrew-Dunning-NNL""]
```
If not, could you contact the developers of this package and see if they are interested? You can quickly see who has worked on a package with `spack blame`:

```bash
$ spack blame rdma-core
```
Thank you for your help! Please don't add maintainers without their consent.

_You don't have to be a Spack expert or package developer in order to be a ""maintainer,"" it just gives us a list of users willing to review PRs or debug issues relating to this package. A package can have multiple maintainers; just add a list of GitHub handles of anyone who wants to volunteer._

34194823,IssueCommentEvent,Thanks @alexvannobel!
34194823,IssueCommentEvent,"I've updated the documentation in commit d1a5f8e79a6057ce781549c176633f972c7c37bd with an example for how to move to specific joint angles. For more complicated movements (eg: to particular end-effector poses) you can use a planning library like MoveIt! (I've added a link to that documentation as well in the same commit). Since this library exposes a ROS FollowJointTrajectory topic, this library should play nicely with MoveIt!."

You can add a comment to the PR and tag @pytorchbot with the following commands:
<br/>

```sh
# ciflow rerun, ""ciflow/default"" will always be added automatically
@pytorchbot ciflow rerun

# ciflow rerun with additional labels ""-l <ciflow/label_name>"", which is equivalent to adding these labels manually and trigger the rerun
@pytorchbot ciflow rerun -l ciflow/scheduled -l ciflow/slow
```

54082712,IssueCommentEvent,"<!-- validation-comment-start --><body>Hello there! From the DISABLED prefix in this issue title, it looks like you are attempting to disable a test in PyTorch CI. The information I have parsed is below:

* Test name: `test_random_seed (__main__.TestDataLoaderUtils)`
* Platforms for which to skip the test: none parsed, defaulting to ALL platforms

Within ~15 minutes, `test_random_seed (__main__.TestDataLoaderUtils)` will be disabled in PyTorch CI for all platforms. Please verify that your test name looks correct, e.g., `test_cuda_assert_async (__main__.TestCuda)`.

To modify the platforms list, please include a line in the issue body, like below. The default action will disable the test for all platforms if no platforms list is specified. 
```
Platforms: case-insensitive, list, of, platforms
```
We currently support the following platforms: asan, linux, mac, macos, rocm, win, windows.</body><!-- validation-comment-end -->"

Repro:  using `sil_euro_latin`...

1.  With your left hand, repeatedly mash between the ""numeric"" and ""shift"" layer shifting keys.  You're going for a rapid layer rotation.
2.  **Simultaneously**, with your right hand, repeatedly mash text-outputting keys.

Corresponding events to the one linked above should appear on Sentry.

In essence, this happens when two touches are near-simutaneous.  If touch 1 is for a switch key, it takes a little time for JS and the browser's renderer to complete the OSK layer-switching operation; it's quite possible for touch 2 to arrive while the original layer is still in place.  In such a case, touch 2 will register against the corresponding key on the original layer, leading to this error - the selected key is not on the _current_ layer at the time that touch 2 gets processed."

45753747,IssueCommentEvent,"Hello @huberttrz and thanks for reporting.

Indeed there is a regression we have missed when you launch the docker image with only default value:
the installer is launched in _interactive mode_ and fails at first prompt when the user is asked to choose between the CLI or browser installation.

The workaround until we fix it (most probably in next hotfix release) is to explicitly define the bind address upon launch, typically:

```sh
docker run -p 8080:8080 pydio/cells --bind :8080
```

In this case there really isn't any reason not to have the tests go in
at the same time. The explanation in the v10 CL is:
    
    Changes since v9:
    
     * The patches to build Scalar and run its tests as part of Git's CI/PR,
       have been dropped because a recent unrelated patch series does not
       interact well with them.

That assessment isn't correct.

The change in v8->v9 of adding a ""make &&"" before the ""test"" was only
necessary because of a logic error in the v8 version. Yes it broke
because the ""scalar test"" target didn't know how to build its
prerequisites, but the real underlying issue is that it was even trying
at that point. It had no business running in the static-analysis target
where we hadn't built git already.

Now v9->v10 has
dropped the tests entirely, allegedly due to an interaction with my
ab/ci-updates, but there's nothing new there that isn't also the case on
""master"".

But we can have our cake and eat it too.

The below patch on top of v9 would make the scalar tests do the right
thing. I.e. whenever we do a ""make test"" we'll run the scalar tests
too.

The code changes somewhat with ab/ci-updates, but the conflict with
js/scalar is mostly textual, not semantic (and as I've pointed out, to
the extent that ab/ci-updates changed anything it made things a bit
better for js/scalar).

I'd really like to see this scalar series land, but I really don't see
why it's necessary to entirety eject the CI test coverage due to what's
a rather trivilly solved issue.

As I've noted ad-nauseum at this point I think the necessity for the
below patch is rather silly, this should just nicely integrate with
""make test"", but <brokenrecord.gif>. But even without that IMO better
approach it's clearly rather trivial to make this series have test
coverage.

It was just broken because it added a test run to the ""pedantic"" run,
and didn't properly integrate with the multi-""make test"" runs on
""master"" , both of which are addressed by the patch below.

I still think a couple things in patch 2 deserve some comments about
the expectations.  Other than that, though, the series reads nicely
and I was only able to spot a few other very minor items.

This re-roll fixes a stupid mistake of mine pointed out by SZEDER[1]
(thanks!): I was redirecting to ""stderr"" across function calls, but
some of those changed directories. Now we'll pass around an absolute
path from the top-level function.

That bug hid an issue where we'd include the trace output in that
stderr log still due to an interpolation of $(pwd), we can just change
that to $PWD, which won't have that issue.

Now that find_bisection() accepts multiple boolean arguments, these may
be combined into a single unsigned integer in order to declutter some of
the code in bisect.c

Also, rename existing the ""flags"" bitfield to ""commit_flags"", to
explicitly differentiate between the new ""bisect_flags"" bitfield.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority, so other packages depending on you could benefit from your bug fixes and new features.

You can find below the list of errors reported by **semantic-release**. Each one of them has to be resolved in order to automatically publish your package. I’m sure you can resolve this 💪.

Errors are usually caused by a misconfiguration or an authentication problem. With each error reported below you will find explanation and guidance to help you to resolve it.

Once all the errors are resolved, **semantic-release** will release your package the next time you push a commit to the `master` branch. You can also manually restart the failed CI job that runs **semantic-release**.

If you are not sure how to resolve this, here is some links that can help you:
- [Usage documentation](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/caribou/docs/usage/README.md)
- [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/caribou/docs/support/FAQ.md)
- [Support channels](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#get-help)

If those don’t help, or if this issue is reporting something you think isn’t right, you can always ask the humans behind **[semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/issues/new)**.

### Invalid npm token.

The [npm token](https://github.com/semantic-release/npm/blob/master/README.md#npm-registry-authentication) configured in the `NPM_TOKEN` environment variable must be a valid [token](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/working_with_tokens) allowing to publish to the registry `https://registry.npmjs.org`.

If you are using Two-Factor Authentication, make configure the `auth-only` [level](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-two-factor-authentication#levels-of-authentication) is supported. **semantic-release** cannot publish with the default `auth-and-writes` level.

Please make sure to set the `NPM_TOKEN` environment variable in your CI with the exact value of the npm token.

44246292,IssueCommentEvent,"@patricksimonian When a pull request (PR) is over the 200-400 line range (of change) the ability of the reviewer to effectively detect issues quickly diminishes. Your PR is over the preferred length of 300 lines set for this repo. While this cannot always be avoided, please be mindful of the reviewer's time by organizing your work into smaller, more manageable PRs.

I think error is like function - seemed potentially useful, but never

All of these should be implemented.  In particular, I think there are many
examples of structs in the various examples of semantic patches.  So
perhaps I haven't understood the question properly.

To my recollection, you made the report, and then I said that I had pushed
new changes that should help with OCaml 5.0.  I just checked on github,
and the changes are there:

# Team's Response
Hi there! Thanks so much for the report.

After testing by following the steps you mentioned, we have determined that the cause of this bug is that the `jar` file is launched by double-clicking the application, and the default system Java version (which differs from the required version) is used. Thus, this is not a fault of the application, and we would like to reject this issue.

Once again, thank you so much for informing us regarding the error.

Cheers,
Coydir

23072004,IssueCommentEvent,"# Changelogs
## coverage 5.0.3
----------------------------

- A performance improvement in 5.0.2 didn't work for test suites that changed
  directory before combining data, causing ""Couldn't use data file: no such
  table: meta"" errors (`issue 916`_).  This is now fixed.

- Coverage could fail to run your program with some form of ""ModuleNotFound"" or
  ""ImportError"" trying to import from the current directory. This would happen
  if coverage had been packaged into a zip file (for example, on Windows), or
  was found indirectly (for example, by pyenv-virtualenv).  A number of
  different scenarios were described in `issue 862`_ which is now fixed.  Huge
  thanks to Agbonze O. Jeremiah for reporting it, and Alexander Waters and
  George-Cristian Bîrzan for protracted debugging sessions.

- Added the ""premain"" debug option.

- Added SQLite compile-time options to the ""debug sys"" output.

.. _changes_502:


## coverage 5.0.2
----------------------------

- Programs that used multiprocessing and changed directories would fail under
  coverage.  This is now fixed (`issue 890`_).  A side effect is that debug
  information about the config files read now shows absolute paths to the
  files.

- When running programs as modules (``coverage run -m``) with ``--source``,
  some measured modules were imported before coverage starts.  This resulted in
  unwanted warnings (""Already imported a file that will be measured"") and a
  reduction in coverage totals (`issue 909`_).  This is now fixed.

- If no data was collected, an exception about ""No data to report"" could happen
  instead of a 0% report being created (`issue 884`_).  This is now fixed.

- The handling of source files with non-encodable file names has changed.
  Previously, if a file name could not be encoded as UTF-8, an error occurred,
  as described in `issue 891`_.  Now, those files will not be measured, since
  their data would not be recordable.

- A new warning (""dynamic-conflict"") is issued if two mechanisms are trying to
  change the dynamic context.  Closes `issue 901`_.

- ``coverage run --debug=sys`` would fail with an AttributeError. This is now
  fixed (`issue 907`_).

14700466,IssueCommentEvent,"@luislobo Thanks for posting!  We'll take a look as soon as possible.

In the mean time, there are a few ways you can help speed things along:
 - look for a workaround.  _(Even if it's just temporary, sharing your solution can save someone else a lot of time and effort.)_
 - tell us why this issue is important to you and your team.  What are you trying to accomplish?  _(Submissions with a little bit of human context tend to be easier to understand and faster to resolve.)_
 - make sure you've provided clear instructions on how to reproduce the bug from a clean install.
 - double-check that you've provided all of the requested version and dependency information.  _(Some of this info might seem irrelevant at first, like which database adapter you're using, but we ask that you include it anyway.  Oftentimes an issue is caused by a confluence of unexpected factors, and it can save everybody a ton of time to know all the details up front.)_
 - read the [code of conduct](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/contributing/code-of-conduct).
 - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your issue](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_
 - let us know if you are using a 3rd party plugin; whether that's a database adapter, a non-standard view engine, or any other dependency maintained by someone other than our core team.  _(Besides the name of the 3rd party package, it helps to include the exact version you're using.  If you're unsure, check out [this list of all the core packages we maintain](https://sailsjs.com/architecture).)_

I recommend you give this issue a high priority, so other packages depending on you can benefit from your bug fixes and new features again.

You can find below the list of errors reported by **semantic-release**. Each one of them has to be resolved in order to automatically publish your package. I’m sure you can fix this 💪.

Errors are usually caused by a misconfiguration or an authentication problem. With each error reported below you will find explanation and guidance to help you to resolve it.

Once all the errors are resolved, **semantic-release** will release your package the next time you push a commit to the `7.x` branch. You can also manually restart the failed CI job that runs **semantic-release**.

If you are not sure how to resolve this, here are some links that can help you:
- [Usage documentation](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/caribou/docs/usage/README.md)
- [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/caribou/docs/support/FAQ.md)
- [Support channels](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#get-help)

If those don’t help, or if this issue is reporting something you think isn’t right, you can always ask the humans behind **[semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/issues/new)**.

### The release `7.58.0` on branch `7.x` cannot be published as it is out of range.

Based on the releases published on other branches, only versions within the range `>=7.57.0 <7.57.0` can be published from branch `7.x`.

The following commits are responsible for the invalid release:
- feat: apim-3748 notification banner when expire today (d45b315)
- fix: am-2140 contact link in notification banner (6b39fb9)
- chore: allow circleci to release 7.x branche (9fe851c)
- fix(gio-form-tags-input): refresh on form control changes (8a8cb50)

Those commits should be moved to a valid branch with [git merge](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge) or [git cherry-pick](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick) and removed from branch `7.x` with [git revert](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert) or [git reset](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset).

A valid branch could be `main`.

See the [workflow configuration documentation](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/workflow-configuration.md) for more details.

### Micro-Learning Topic: Cross-site scripting (Detected by phrase)

#### Matched on ""Cross-site Scripting""

*[What is this? (2min video)](https://media.securecodewarrior.com/v2/Module_71_Cross+Site+Scripting_v2.mp4)*

Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities occur when unescaped input is rendered into a page displayed to the user. When HTML or script is included in the input, it will be processed by a user's browser as HTML or script and can alter the appearance of the page or execute malicious scripts in their user context.

    <summary display=""inline""> <strong>Why proper sizing of changes matters</strong> </summary>
    <p/>
    <p/>

Optimal pull request sizes drive a better predictable PR flow as they strike a
balance between between PR complexity and PR review overhead. PRs within the
optimal size (typical small, or medium sized PRs) mean:

- Fast and predictable releases to production:
  - Optimal size changes are more likely to be reviewed faster with fewer
iterations.
  - Similarity in low PR complexity drives similar review times.
- Review quality is likely higher as complexity is lower:
  - Bugs are more likely to be detected.
  - Code inconsistencies are more likely to be detected.
- Knowledge sharing is improved within the participants:
  - Small portions can be assimilated better.
- Better engineering practices are exercised:
  - Solving big problems by dividing them in well contained, smaller problems.
  - Exercising separation of concerns within the code changes.

#### What can I do to optimize my changes

- Use the PullRequestQuantifier to quantify your PR accurately
  - Create a context profile for your repo using the [context generator](https://github.com/microsoft/PullRequestQuantifier/releases)
  - Exclude files that are not necessary to be reviewed or do not increase the review complexity. Example: Autogenerated code, docs, project IDE setting files, binaries, etc. Check out the `Excluded` section from your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile. 
  - Understand your typical change complexity, drive towards the desired complexity by adjusting the label mapping in your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile.
  - Only use the labels that matter to you, [see context specification](./docs/prquantifier-yaml.md) to customize your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile.
- Change your engineering behaviors
  - For PRs that fall outside of the desired spectrum, review the details and check if:
    - Your PR could be split in smaller, self-contained PRs instead
    - Your PR only solves one particular issue. (For example, don't refactor and code new features in the same PR).

#### How to interpret the change counts in git diff output

- One line was added: `+1 -0`
- One line was deleted: `+0 -1`
- One line was modified: `+1 -1` (git diff doesn't know about modified, it will
interpret that line like one addition plus one deletion)
- Change percentiles: Change characteristics (addition, deletion, modification)
of this PR in relation to all other PRs within the repository.

72744584,IssueCommentEvent,"@darshankawar No crash reports found. I used the following overrides
when looking for reports

```
SymbolizationOverrides(engineHash: null, flutterVersion: null, arch: null, mode: null, force: false, format: null, os: null)
```

Note that I can only find native Android and iOS crash reports automatically,
you need to explicitly point me to crash reports in other supported formats.

If the crash report is embedded into a log and prefixed with additional
information I might not be able to automatically strip those prefixes.
Currently I only support `flutter run -v`, `adb logcat` and device lab logs.

See [my documentation](https://github.com/flutter-symbolizer-bot/flutter-symbolizer-bot/blob/main/README.md#commands) for more details on how to do that.

The userspace part is already thoroughly tested by the existing memory 
domain tests.

The Stackguard part is being improved even further with proper guard 
area sizing and more tests but that will come in a subsequent PR. This 
one already represents a significant improvement over the existing 
broken code.

Oh I see. The row format is saved now."
702790,IssueCommentEvent,"You could do:

```
static inline bool big_heap_bytes(size_t bytes)

static inline bool big_heap(struct z_heap *h)
{
        return big_heap_bytes(h->usable_bytes);

And to replace `h->end_chunk` in heap-validate.c:

```
static inline chunkid_t end_chunk(struct z_heap *h)
{
	return chunk_size(h, 0) + bytes_to_chunksz(h, h->usable_bytes);
}

The entire heap size may overflow the available 15 bits in a small heap as
size of chunk 0 is not accounted for here, but we never have to store it
anywhere.

Right. If UTVEC and friends are implemented then MSTATUS/SSTATUS/USTATUS 
etc. could be abstracted behind some
macros. Linux does this:

```
#ifdef CONFIG_RISCV_M_MODE
# define CSR_STATUS     CSR_MSTATUS
# define CSR_IE         CSR_MIE
# define CSR_TVEC       CSR_MTVEC
# define CSR_SCRATCH    CSR_MSCRATCH
# define CSR_EPC        CSR_MEPC
# define CSR_CAUSE      CSR_MCAUSE
# define CSR_TVAL       CSR_MTVAL
# define CSR_IP         CSR_MIP
[...]
#else /* CONFIG_RISCV_M_MODE */
# define CSR_STATUS     CSR_SSTATUS
# define CSR_IE         CSR_SIE
# define CSR_TVEC       CSR_STVEC
# define CSR_SCRATCH    CSR_SSCRATCH
# define CSR_EPC        CSR_SEPC
# define CSR_CAUSE      CSR_SCAUSE
# define CSR_TVAL       CSR_STVAL
# define CSR_IP         CSR_SIP
[...]
#endif
```

And then only a few corner cases are conditionally selected with 
`CONFIG_RISCV_M_MODE` in the actual code. Applying this approach to Zephyr 
and extending it to u-mode as well (for available U regs) would be perfectly 
fine to me.

However, given this is deep architecture stuff, we'd need a way for CI to
make sure the u-mode build won't go broken i.e. this needs to work using
QEMU. I don't know if QEMU has e.g. UTVEC implemented but a quick grep
seems to indicate it is not.

### Library name and version

Azure.Keyvault.Secrets 4.4.0

### Describe the bug

I recovered a deleted secret (called testSecret) using `SecretClient.StartRecoverDeletedSecretAsync()` and waited for the recovery process to finish using `WaitForCompletionAsync`. When I (immediately) try to set a new secret value using `SecretClient.SetSecretAsync()` I **sometimes** get 'Azure.RequestFailedException' with a 409 ""Secret testSecret is currently being recovered and cannot be re-created; retry later""

### Expected behavior

When StartRecoverDeletedSecretAsync() has finished succesfully, I am always able to set a new value for that secret.

### Actual behavior

Sometimes SetSecretAsync() returns a 409 with message ""Secret testSecret is currently being recovered and cannot be re-created; retry later."" with 'innererror': ""ObjectIsBeingRecovered"".

For testing purposes, I have been testing the same piece of code (delete secret, recover secret, and set secret value) in a loop. Sometimes it runs without issue, sometimes I get a 409 when setting the secret value. I've implemented a Polly retry mechanism as well to retry SetSecretAsyn() upon getting Azure.RequestFailedException, and often it succeeds after 1 or multiple retries.

### Reproduction Steps

- Secret ""testSecret"" in KeyVault in 'deleted' state and is 'recoverable' 

```
string secretName = ""testSecret""
string secretValue = ""testSecretValue""
bool Success = true;

// Recover deleted secret
RecoverDeletedSecretOperation operation = await _keyVaultSecretClient.StartRecoverDeletedSecretAsync(secretName);
await operation.WaitForCompletionAsync();
Success &= operation.HasCompleted && operation.Value.Enabled == true;
if (!isSuccess){
  return
}

// Set new secret value
KeyVaultSecret newSecretValue = new KeyVaultSecret(secretName, secretValue );
// Error occurs here
Azure.Response<KeyVaultSecret> response = await _keyVaultSecretClient.SetSecretAsync(newSecretValue);
KeyVaultSecret storedSecretValue = response?.Value;
isSuccess = storedSecretValue?.Value == newSecretValue.Value;

// Delete secret again (for next test iteration)
DeleteSecretOperation operation = await _keyVaultSecretClient.StartDeleteSecretAsync(secretName);
await operation.WaitForCompletionAsync();
```

### Environment

- .NET core 3.1
- IDE Visual Studio 17.3
- Keyvault with soft delete enabled

I recommend you give this issue a high priority, so other packages depending on you could benefit from your bug fixes and new features.

You can find below the list of errors reported by **semantic-release**. Each one of them has to be resolved in order to automatically publish your package. I’m sure you can resolve this 💪.

Errors are usually caused by a misconfiguration or an authentication problem. With each error reported below you will find explanation and guidance to help you to resolve it.

Once all the errors are resolved, **semantic-release** will release your package the next time you push a commit to the `master` branch. You can also manually restart the failed CI job that runs **semantic-release**.

If you are not sure how to resolve this, here is some links that can help you:

<summary>🛠 Guidelines to remediate hardcoded secrets</summary>
<br>

1. Understand the implications of revoking this secret by investigating where it is used in your code.
2. Replace and store your secrets safely. [Learn here](https://blog.gitguardian.com/secrets-api-management?utm_source=product&amp;utm_medium=GitHub_checks&amp;utm_campaign=check_run_comment) the best practices.
3. Revoke and [rotate these secrets](https://docs.gitguardian.com/secrets-detection/detectors/generics/generic_high_entropy_secret#revoke-the-secret?utm_source=product&amp;utm_medium=GitHub_checks&amp;utm_campaign=check_run_comment).
4. If possible, [rewrite git history](https://blog.gitguardian.com/rewriting-git-history-cheatsheet?utm_source=product&amp;utm_medium=GitHub_checks&amp;utm_campaign=check_run_comment). Rewriting git history is not a trivial act. You might completely break other contributing developers' workflow and you risk accidentally deleting legitimate data.

To avoid such incidents in the future consider

-   following these [best practices](https://blog.gitguardian.com/secrets-api-management/?utm_source=product&amp;utm_medium=GitHub_checks&amp;utm_campaign=check_run_comment) for managing and storing secrets including API keys and other credentials
-   install [secret detection on pre-commit](https://docs.gitguardian.com/internal-repositories-monitoring/integrations/git_hooks/pre_commit?utm_source=product&amp;utm_medium=GitHub_checks&amp;utm_campaign=check_run_comment) to catch secret before it leaves your machine and ease remediation.

<summary>🛠 Guidelines to remediate hardcoded secrets</summary>
<br>

1. Understand the implications of revoking this secret by investigating where it is used in your code.
2. Replace and store your secrets safely. [Learn here](https://blog.gitguardian.com/secrets-api-management?utm_source=product&amp;utm_medium=GitHub_checks&amp;utm_campaign=check_run_comment) the best practices.
3. Revoke and [rotate these secrets](https://docs.gitguardian.com/secrets-detection/detectors/specifics/mongo_uri#revoke-the-secret?utm_source=product&amp;utm_medium=GitHub_checks&amp;utm_campaign=check_run_comment).
4. If possible, [rewrite git history](https://blog.gitguardian.com/rewriting-git-history-cheatsheet?utm_source=product&amp;utm_medium=GitHub_checks&amp;utm_campaign=check_run_comment). Rewriting git history is not a trivial act. You might completely break other contributing developers' workflow and you risk accidentally deleting legitimate data.

To avoid such incidents in the future consider

-   following these [best practices](https://blog.gitguardian.com/secrets-api-management/?utm_source=product&amp;utm_medium=GitHub_checks&amp;utm_campaign=check_run_comment) for managing and storing secrets including API keys and other credentials
-   install [secret detection on pre-commit](https://docs.gitguardian.com/internal-repositories-monitoring/integrations/git_hooks/pre_commit?utm_source=product&amp;utm_medium=GitHub_checks&amp;utm_campaign=check_run_comment) to catch secret before it leaves your machine and ease remediation.
