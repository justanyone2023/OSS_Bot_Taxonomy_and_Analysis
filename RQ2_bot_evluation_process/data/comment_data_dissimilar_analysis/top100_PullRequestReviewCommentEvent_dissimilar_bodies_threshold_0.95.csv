We could also consider just uploading these packages to the dotnetcli blob storage, with names that sort of match the old scheme (replacing -ubuntu with -ubuntu.14.04-x64 ideally to disambiguate between ubuntu versions), if that's preferable (I would need to chat quickly with @piotrpMSFT before doing so, but it might be helpful for them to have them for bootstrapping anyway)."

26720499,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,This would've been handy when we were writing our server implementation last year. :grinning: 
26720499,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Based on my understanding of the Windows command interpreter, I think this should work both there and in POSIX shells. It might _not_ work on PowerShell on Windows, because that adds an extra level of escaping that is often hard to deal with, but that's not a new problem nor something we can easily address in the documentation here.

With that said, the lead-in text here suggests that all of these forms are things the user might expect to see in the output of other commands, and so the escaping here is making that no longer strictly true. Perhaps we should hint that with some parenthetical text:

> * `aws_instance.baz[\""key\""]` (quotes in resource addresses must be escaped on the command line so that they are not interpreted by your shell)

I understand there's nuance here, and that whatever signature the UTop_compat has is find as long as it fits the usage, but then I have to also consider and write about this, and for someone getting started this nuance seemed unnecessary.

854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Love this! ✨ 
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"This feels like tying a few things together: batching the future creation, executing the batches one after another, and collecting the results.

I'd have expected something like:

```reason

/* this is the part where I prepare my data for the concurrent execution */
module type List = {
  /* take a list of 'a, and an int for how many to put in each bucket */
  let chunks_of: (int, list('a)) => list(list('a));
};

let futures = [1, 2, 3, 4] |. List.map(x => () => Future.value(x)); /* this could also be lazy futures */
let maxConcurrency = 2;
let chunks: list(list(unit => Future.t(int)) = List.chunks_of(maxConcurrency, futures);
/* [ [() => Future(1), () => Future(2)], [() => Future(3), () => Future(4)] ] */

/* this is the part where I build up the computation */
module type Future = {
  let all: (list(t('a)), list('a) => 'b); /* from https://github.com/RationalJS/future/issues/16 */
};

let sequence: list(list(unit => Future.t('a))) => Future.t(list(list('a)) = chunks => {
  let rec consumer = (cs, acc) => {
    switch (cs) {
    | [] => Future.value(acc);
    | [h, ...t] => {
        /* initialize all futures in this chunk: this would be more elegant using Lazy/Force */
       Future.all(List.map(x => x(), h))
       |. Future.flatMap(results => consumer(t, [results, ...acc])))
      }
    }
  };
  consumer(chunks, []);
};

/* this is the part where you consume it */
later_values.get( values => Js.log(values) );
```

Of course this is just a sketch but it's a bit more elegant, it (from what I can see) won't throw any exceptions anywhere, it can still be optimized with mutable cursors and good ol' `while` loops if the performance needs it.

Just a thought! Good work @dvisztempacct on pushing for concurrency idioms in the library 🙌 "
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"> @dvisztempacct: each ""chunk"" must be processed serially
Oh, perhaps I misinterpreted the idea behind your `maxConcurrent`. I thought it to mean that Future's should be batched in groups of at most `maxConcurrent`.

Naturally if that wasn't the goal the implementation above can be changed by replacing the `Future.sequence` call with a `Scheduler`/`TaskRunner` that can take care of this concern.

Thanks for pointing this out! 💯 

> @dvisztempacct: This sort of design also gives the allocator a much greater workout
If by allocator you mean whoever uses this library, yes. If you mean the runtime, you'd still be creating a function for every `xs[i] |. f |. get( x => ... )` 🤔. Optimizations on both ends can be made to reuse the functions (in your case you have everything already in the upper scope, so it should be trivial to extract). It'd be interesting to compare the compiled Javascript of both solutions.

In the end your implementation will run faster than mine by the nature of it's design. I'll extract a Scheduler from it and perhaps then we can compare more fairly 👍 "
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,@scull7 essentially this bit -> https://github.com/jonlaing/rationale/blob/master/src/Monad.re#L48-L54
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"But it's different from what @dvisztempacct implemented tho! His Future pool keeps a constant number of promises running, whereas using `all` or `all_ignore` will run them in sequence, one by one AFAICT."
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"**suggestion**. This wrapping looks good but we can improve it a little bit since if `main ()` returns an error we will have a runtime exception and the application will crash without shutting down the engine correctly.

The right way of handling this would be to pattern-match on `main ()` and handle both the `Ok status` case and the `Error reason` case.

For the Ok case, your current code looks good.

For the error case, we will need to ask the user how to handle it. We can this by also accepting a new parameter like `on_error` which by default is defined as a function that handles `` `Msg string `` errors:

```ocaml
let default_on_error (`Msg reason) = 
  (* ... print error msg ... *)
```

This would allow a user to also pass in their own function if they want to have other kinds of errors handled.

What's important is that _after_ calling their function, we always call `shutdown ()`."
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,**suggestion**. we can use `Log.error` here.
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"**suggestion**. prefer `match` instead of folding:

```suggestion
      let status = match main () with
        | Ok code -> code
        | Error reason -> on_error reason
      in
```"
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"**suggestino**. If we are more general about the `'error` that we return and how to handle it, we can have a smaller error type for our `default_on_error` function.


```suggestion
val run_with_status : ?rnd:Random.State.t -> ?workers:int -> ?on_error:('error -> int) -> (unit -> (int, 'error) result) -> unit
```

This change should mean that you can return whatever error type you want, as long as you use an `on_error` function that supports it. If you use the default, then the only error type you can return is ` [| `Msg of string ] `."
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Left you a few comments that should help with this :)
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Love this bits of trivia <3 but I'd put them all the way at the _end_ of the tutorial. Almost an appendix for those that are interested in deepening the context in which polyvars where created.
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Looking at the learning goals for this page, I'm not sure if this clarification helps me write/use/assess polyvars at all.

Feels like a ""nice to know"" but not a ""must know""."
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Love this! ✨ I think I'd phrase it around skills/concepts rather than completed tutorials, and it could be placed right below the main title or in a dedicated section so the very first thing I notice is whether I need to learn something _before_ digging into this tutorial."
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"An even smaller example we could use here that I think would cement the intuition that polyvars are closer to the data itself than to defined types would be a list:

```ocaml
# let my_favorite_fruits = [ `banana ];;
val my_favorite_fruits : [> `banana ] list

# let my_favorite_fruits = [ `banana; `apple ];;
val my_favorite_fruits : [> `apple | `banana ] list

# let my_favorite_fruits = [ `banana; `apple; `kiwi ];;
val my_favorite_fruits : [> `apple | `banana | `kiwi ] list
```"
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Could be a good path to build from:

1. `` `banana `` is of type `` [> `banana ] ``
2. if you put it together with other things that are their own type (`` `apple ``) then they form a larger type (`` [> `apple | `banana ] ``)"
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Consider that if I jump into this section, I don't know where `f` came from or what it is. Keeping it self-contained should be okay since these examples are super small."
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,This section seems unnecessary if the remarks of the LLM hallucinating are removed.
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"> ""Only using polymorphic variants is over-engineering,""
I also don't recommend people to _only use polyvars_ but I think we can do better and explain _why_.

For example, the type errors can get VERY out of hand.

Also not sure why reiterating the whole ""not an extension, but equivalent"" is relevant."
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"When you write ""weaken type-checking"" are you referring to having both a `Gray` and `Grey` tags? I assumed this was meant to be an example of an accident/typo, but I don't think its fair to call it ""weakened type-checking"".

Like the compiler isn't going to mistake `Grey` for `Gray`."
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Instead of a Conclusion i'd have a section that summarizes what was learned in this tutorial:

* We learned how to create new polymorphic variant tags
* We learned how to to constraint them 
* We learned how to reuse tags
* We learned how to use polymorphic variants for flexible error handling
* etc"
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"As a rule of thumb, we tend to open Riot at the top of every file, to avoid having to open it in other places."
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"**suggestion**. from looking at how we're using this call (`border (get_border Thick)`) I think we could just export predefined borders from the Border module and use them like this, without needing a `get_border` function:

```ocaml
let overlay_border fmt =
  Spices.(default |> border Border.double |> build) fmt
```"
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"**fix**. let's add a signature for the Border module here, like:

```ocaml
module Border : sig
  type t

  val make : 
    ?bottom:string ->
    ?bottom_left:string ->
    ?bottom_right:string ->
    ?left:string ->
    ?middle:string ->
    ?middle_bottom:string ->
    ?middle_left:string ->
    ?middle_right:string ->
    ?middle_top:string ->
    ?right:string ->
    ?top:string ->
    ?top_left:string ->
    ?top_right:string ->
    unit ->
    t

  val normal : t
  val rounded : t
  (* other predefined borders here *)
end
```
"
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"```suggestion
    () =
```"
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Could we move the `modifier` up to the `KeyDown` constructor? 

```ocaml
type t =
 | KeyDown of key * modifier
```

I think this would allow you to pass in modifier for the special keys too, while keeping all the pattern matching ergonomic:

```ocaml
let update t e = 
  match e with
  | KeyDown (Key ""h"" | Left, Ctrl) -> prev_page t
  | KeyDown (Key ""l"" | Right, None) -> next_page t
```"
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"**suggestion**. Another thought is that to avoid the `(Some Ctrl)` wrapper when we want `Ctrl` we could make the `modifier` type just include a ""no-modifier"" variant like `None`:

```ocaml
type modifier = | None | Ctrl
```

Stuffing this type with combinations would also make it easier to check for Ctrl + Shift by just using `CtrlShift` instead of trying to have a set / list.

What do you think? "
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"This looks good, it was likely an oversight!"
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"**question**. Could we change this to `dune-release` to automatically open a PR to Opam? 

`dune-release` should also take care of creating and pushing the git tag to the repo."
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,**fix**. can we use `sha256sum` here instead of encoding as base64?
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"I think we may be able to use `dune-release` on its own, like:

```suggestion
        git tag ""$new_version""
        yes | opam exec -- dune-release --no-auto-open
```

Since `dune-release` behaves like: distrib + publish + opam pkg + opam submit

I may be wrong tho, since I haven't tried using dune-release in a non-interactive way."

Which makes me think that either the test is testing the wrong thing, or that `with_span/2` isn't honoring the links as I had expected it to. Considering there's no way of manually building a `OpenTelemetry.span_ctx()`, I'd expect it to treat links as such."

854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"I think the older description was better here since it describes a functor by analogy with something else that people may be familiar with. 

I'd take it a little further and say that functors _are functions_ but that instead of regular values they take modules as inputs and create modules as outputs. 

This intuition I think can help with other things, like the ""transitive closures leading to modules"" prerequisite."
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"```suggestion
(** This is the signature of the module returned by applying `Make` *)
module type S = sig
```"
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Here for example thinking of `Make` as a function would be rather useful, since the signature, especially the right side of `functor` looks a lot like a function type."
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Some notes here:

* I'm not sure about the `dune exec` sentence here, do we need to associate functors with calls to `dune`? Could we just explain the meaning of the `Set.Make` call directly?

* If we use a `struct ... end` to make the input module explicit, we don't have to explain why String magically fits."
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"I think the whole parsing inputs and splitting by regexp is not adding to working with our functor here, and a hardcoded example would do just the same.

```ocaml
let () = 
  let set = StringSet.of_list [""hello"", ""world"", ""world""] in
  StringSet.iter (fun line -> print_endline line) set
```

BUT this makes me think that we haven't given functors a good raison d'être – like why do we even have functors to begin with?

Why does `Set` must be a functor but `Hashtbl` doesn't need to? 

And why does `Hashtbl` offer a `Hashtbl.Make` functor?

I'm realizing I don't know exactly what this is but let's say its because:
* we don't have a polymorphic `compare`
* we do have a polymorphic `hash`

If we had a polymorphic `compare` would we be using `Set` as an example here?
"
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,I think I'm missing _why_ we need to use the functor provided by `Set` here – even a small justification for how we want to _reuse_ the functionality of a Set but with a custom `compare` operation.
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"If we focus on the usage of the new set rather than input, regex splitting, etc, we wouldn't need much of this."

46721658,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Let's use consistent terminology for both: `castToX(fromY:)`  https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/69069
46721658,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"It's a bit more convenient to use `dump()` than `print(std::outs())` on the C++ side.  And both sides need to write to the same file and flush before switching to the other language's handle.  Anyway, here's a PR https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/69080 to use stdout."
46721658,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Yeah, we can assert that--`projecteds` is empty if and only `findDefProjections` returns false.  Asserted here and for findUseProjections.

I don't think we can skip updating the LCA here: it needs to dominate `defInst->getParent()`.  The structure of chain projections is such that in order for a def projection to appear, it has to look something like this (`projection_chain_structure`):

```
parent:
  %val = ...
  cond_br ..., left, right

left:
  %d = disaggregate %val
  ...

right:
  %a = aggregate %val

...

  br merge( aggregate(...(aggregate(%a)...) )
```

In this case, so far so good: we'd update the LCA with `%d = disaggregate %val` which would make `parent` the LCA.  If the branch that's the LCA of `disaggregate` and `aggregate` is different from the block containing the def `%val`, however, the LCA is after the def block:


```
grandparent:
  %val = ...
  cond_br ..., parent, other

parent:
  cond_br ..., left, right

left:
  %d = disaggregate %val
  ...

right:
  %a = aggregate %val

...

  br merge( aggregate(...(aggregate(%a)...) )
```

In the worst case, because the LCA is wrong, the walk where liveness is determined continues past the LCA (since we just compare the current block to the LCA before pushing its predecessors) resulting in redundant `alloc_stack`s.  Without including this `defInst->getParent()` in the LCA computation, PhiStorageOptimizer incorrectly determines that there's interference in `entry` because the walk back from `destroy_value %v` continues all the way to `entry` (because LCA is incorrectly determined to be `parent` rather than `trouble2`.

```

46721658,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Fixed.  It might be nice to add a convenience wrapping that to Type so that some third object didn't have to be consulted.
46721658,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Removed this requestification and moved `SuppressesConformanceRequest` into `TypeCheckRequestFunctions.cpp`.
46721658,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"> With the check we may not be optimizing the case where one path could have the initializing apply, and another uninitialized path may end in an unreachable.
It seems like, even if the address is uninitialized on some `unreachable`-terminated path, every path through `IEAI` would still go through `AI``*` (`AI` would dominate `IEAI`).  But...
> For non empty types we do not have uninitialized paths and won't need this check?
Great point!  This check is wasteful for non-empty types.  Added a check that the type is empty before checking dominance.  And added some test cases with dead end blocks after the `init_enum_data_addr`.

`*` Or some other initialization in which case there's another bailout since the apply case only handles the case where the apply is the single use."
46721658,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Good point, we can't have them here either because that would imply there was a memory location whose type is non-empty which wasn't initialized on some path, which is invalid SIL."
46721658,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,I think having a different representation for this case--the case of a protocol that isn't conformed to by all types by default (i.e. unlike `Copyable`) but is inferred automatically for some types--makes sense.
46721658,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"When there's only a single def (SSAPrunedLiveness), does continuing the search above that single def result in visiting instructions which can't be on the boundary?"
46721658,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"In an example like
```
entry:
    ...
    instructions
    ...
    %def = apply
    ...
    apply(%def) // last use
    ...
    %retval = tuple ()
    return %retval

```

It looks like we'll do the following:
1. set `isLive = false`, `isDefBlock = true`, `nextDef = nullptr`
2. advance searchPos from the end of the block toward the front.  for the first instructions, `isLive` will be false, and since `isDefBlock` is true, we'll check whether instructions are the def.  none of them will be.
3. when searchPos becomes `apply(%def)`; `isInterestingUser` will return something other than NonUser so we'll set `isLive = true`
4. enter the `isLive` condition.  call `findPreviousDef(theLastUse, nullptr)`.  we'll get back `%def = apply`.
5. set `searchPos` to `nextDef`.  set `isLive` to false.
6. keep iterating over the instructions above `%def = apply`.

At least it looks like that's what I'm seeing in the debugger for the following:

46721658,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Folded a fix into https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/66728 via https://github.com/apple/swift/compare/c322ba0353dc6ddda92c9aaccd24a669b991b286..82ba69e31909925436d48b19bc40dc71f430f50c .
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"It's the same code in the same library. Why all the effort?
Isn't this making everything super complicated? :) "
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,We can also tag version 3.0?
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Changed the version in the change log to 3.0.0 :) this should keep the code nice and clean. 

Good feedback on the BC break, I didn't realize that others extend the interface to build their own implementations. "
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Ah, i just did it ;) let me know what you think."
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Fixed :) 
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Thanks! Do you have an example in the code base using the behaviour?
I do understand the reasoning but when I saw you using the `if Application.get_env....` I thought that's actually an easy solution :-) "
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Not sure about `is_auto_generated`, if there is no use-case it could be removed?"
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,The `locale` is now passed in. This could also be removed as the video already has a `language`.
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"This uses `locale` but the video uses `language`. If there is no difference in meaning, `language` might be better for consistency "
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Ooops good one. Thanks! Fixed :) 
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,A docblock would be nice :) Please see the other methods.
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"There is also a [test](https://github.com/php-vcr/php-vcr/blob/master/tests/VCR/CodeTransform/CurlCodeTransformTest.php) for this class, would be great if you could update those tests as well.  "
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Docblocks would be great for this, so the type is clear."
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Good solution. Also docblocks would be great :)
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Why changing this to `void` and not keep the original return type?
http://php.net/manual/en/function.curl-multi-add-handle.php"
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"I didn't see the `config/module.config.php` before. I'll add the `etag` option there.

Cons of that approach:
 * users always have to provide a generator and a correctly configured container. When using a default generator if no generator is given we can avoid that repetition.
 * if a user doesn't provide a generator, it would silently fail (we could throw an exception instead of returning `void`)
 * the generator can already be easily overwritten in the config
 * etags are only on the header if the module config contains a `etag` section

What do you think?"
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,There is a `setNotModifiedDataProvider` which provides which tests two cases when the generation is skipped: when there is no `If-None-Match` header and when there is no match. Is there a case missing?
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,There is the `setEtagDataProvider` which should handle all skipped cases.
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Good idea, will do"
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"space between `of""204 No Content""` ;) "
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"very nice!  :+1: 

Examples could be added to improve it even more.
The UTC timezone format can be also expressed like `UTC-01` (only hours) which is currently not accepted by the timezone validator. An example like `UTC+02:00` could help imo."
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"To me `Assertion::directory($cassettePath, ""Cassette path ""'{$cassettePath}"" is not existing or not a directory"");` would be most understandable, just like the other assertions a bit further down in the constructor. Also it throws the right exception.

The same check is btw done [here](https://github.com/php-vcr/php-vcr/blob/master/src/VCR/Configuration.php#L381) with a very descriptive error message intended for end users. But it certainly doesn't hurt to do it here as well. "
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"It feels a bit like the constructor is doing too much. I would probably extend it to a method/helper. But its right ""at the edge"" so you might as well leave it like it is."
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Mh great find, thanks."
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Mh I see, good to know :-)"
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Yeah its good, makes sense."
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Yes definitely it should be here too. I agree that it is useful in any case.

I guess you're referring to the `VCR` static class. In general I'm not a fan of singletons for various reasons. 

Some background on the reasons for using a singleton in this case: With the current implementation of PHP-VCR I don't see how two Videorecorder instances can exist at the same time. The function calls (`curl`/`SoapClient::*`/...) are overwritten globally and VCR is either intercepting or not. Being able to have more instances would lead to strange bugs. 

Thinking about this... it could be actually possible to whitelist/blacklist some parts of code that does HTTP requests which should be intercepted and use it with one videorecorder instance and another part of code with another. Currently this is not implemented and I'm not sure if it is even worth it ;-)
"
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Ah wait I just saw the wrong usage of quotes here. I'll fix it on master
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Good idea! 

I'm a bit torn where to put the constants. Either on the configuration or directly on the `VCR` class. 

I wanted to provide a nicer interface for adding [events](https://github.com/php-vcr/php-vcr/blob/master/src/VCR/VCREvents.php) as well and was thinking about putting it all on the `VCR` object. That would look like this:

```
VCR::configuration()
    ->setMode(VCR::MODE_NEW_EPISODES)
    ->on(VCR::BEFORE_RECORD, function() {...})
```

What would you like more as a user? `Configuration` or `VCR`. I'm more in favour of `VCR` right now because using only a single interface seems kind of neat."
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Is there really a need to introduce another variable? I would have moved the writeable check down to the `storeRecording` where stuff gets written. The downside is that the check would have to be added in the `Json` and `Yaml` storage. Am I missing something?
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Added https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/issues/4755
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Good call, found an issue https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/4875/commits/117e617a6c0152622b2f2c427af5a157d14d4ec3

Do you think I'm missing any more tests?"
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Mh how do you see this for the user? Do you expect the config to change? If not, how do you see it being used internally? Thanks!"
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,@mikkeloscar Rebased. Is this error rated to my change? 
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Aaaah thanks, what an error message ;) "
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,guess that's what I get when doing this via GitHub ;) thanks pushed.
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,As far as I see [`CURLOPT_UPLOAD`](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_UPLOAD.html) should be used when uploading a file in conjunction with a read function. So it should be still possible to upload files using the `@` notation when we ignore the option.
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,When did you come across this case? As far as I see it's either an upload (with a read function) or a string. See   [CurlFactory](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/blob/ddbbba92efbf3d843baf467dd699b4647105c64a/src/Handler/CurlFactory.php#L224).
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Removing handling the curl option here was probably necessary because it is not clear if `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` have been set yet, right? As far as I understand this came from a special case when using Guzzle 4. Do you think it is possible to leave it here and check for the curl option because Guzzle 4 sets it before the `CURLOPT_READFUNCTION` option?"
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Just for me to know, is the 'application/json' parameter changing anything how Guzzle sends the request? (Except from a `Content-Type` header?"
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"PHP-VCR is still supporting PHP 5.3, please use `array()`."
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,We should still use vfsStream. In theory this shouldn't be a problem to use. Writing to the file system is not handy for repeatable tests since the fixture file then needs to be deleted. 
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,typo?
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,u should suffix the interface name with interface. e.g. DiceInterface
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,don't forge to set the arguments of the dice.
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"rename it to a convention: ""app.dice.d6"""
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"it should already error here, please clear you cache using `php ./bin/console cache:clear`"
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"ok, you don't need your adjustments to the .htaccess etc. just run your app using `php ./bin/console server:run`"
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,not necessary 
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Hey, great thoughts here. I'm a maintainer of php-vcr.  Thanks @dbu for pinging me about this discussion.

A MessageInterface to JSON/XML would be great. I was also thinking of moving php-vcr internally over to use PSR-7, but it makes more sense to create another library which can be used everywhere. 

Php-vcr has an btw [integration with phpunit](https://github.com/php-vcr/phpunit-testlistener-vcr) (but at the moment not phpspec)."
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Thanks for the review!

What do you think of mapping exceptions directly to error classes? Then we don't have to add another parameter to the class and the lookup is even quicker. Memory consumption might be a bit higher.


```php
[
    'Symfony\Component\Routing\Exception\ResourceNotFoundException' => 'Overblog\\GraphQLBundle\\Error\\UserWarning',
    'InvalidArgumentException' => 'Overblog\\GraphQLBundle\\Error\\UserError',
]
```"
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,how did work with `this` work before? Was this change just in precaution if the function is used somewhere else?
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"""fallback for locations who **don't** have physical-BLE-Beacons"""
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"That means when a ""beacon"" is a real beacon, we don't fetch the business rules?"
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Very ES6 :D nice :+1: 
"
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,The `beacon.get('beacon_id')`is not important here right?
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Radius 100 is something that works in all cases? Does this need to be configurable?
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Should that be `LGPL-2.1`?
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Nice use of the `.map` :)
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Should we limit the amount to some constant like `MAX_REGIONS_MONITORED` which is 20 on iOS? 
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Use `fileAction`
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Action!
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"The configuration is currently a simple container for configuration data. All instance creation should happen in the factory and then handed in where it is needed, see ""inversion of control"".

When instance creation logic moves to the `VCRFactory` the `matcherObserver` should not be needed in the configuration."
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Whats the idea with the identity hash?
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,At the moment the MatchObserver is a singleton. It could also be a value object which gets filled with data and then thrown away. 
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"I have the feeling that `hasResponse` and `playback` are conceptually something else than finding out why a request doesn't match. Now it's doing more than one thing (see 'single responsibility principle'). 

How about introducing another method on the `Cassette` which does what you want and is named like that. Like `getMismatchReport()` or `getMismatchInfo()`. I imagine it would return an object like the `MatchObserver` which can be asked for a `getMismatchMessage()`."
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Should be at least `protected`.
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Not sure about the `MatchObserver` name. When I read observer I think of the [observer pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) which isn't really the case here. 

To me it seems like the purpose of that class is to explain mismatches. Maybe `MismatchExplainer`? ;-)"
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"You could also use the [SplObjectStorage](http://php.net/manual/en/class.splobjectstorage.php) for that, which doesn't require adding the `getIdentityHash()` function on the object."
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,I was thinking of doing that way in the beginning when calling `Configuration::addRequestMatcher`. So here `collectMismatches` would get a list of RequestMatcher objects which have a `match` and a `getMismatches` method.
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Do you know why this could be only an issue when running under windows? Is there a difference?
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Looks nice thank you. I wonder though, if we don't catch the exception PHPUnit might throw ErrorExceptions when running in `processIsolation`. Did you test this by any chance?"
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"@laland I like how you moved out the ternary conditional!

What happens when there is another SOAP version coming out? I'd either throw an exception or use the SOAP 1.2 behaviour for other versions (preferred).
Maybe just use a 
`if (SOAP_1_1) {...} else { // >=SOAP_1_2 ...}`"
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Good idea. 
The other method `getHeaderCheckCallback` is now not necessary anymore. To avoid duplication of this logic, could you please use your new `getHeadersCheckCallback` in `testShouldHandleSOAPVersion12`? Your version is more generic and can be reused there too.
"
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Yeah we can wrap the `if` (javascript) in a `if app.debug` (twig) :) 

The reason why I didn't do it was because `app.debug` doesn't necessarily mean that there is no web debug toolbar. I was trying to find a good way to test for that but didn't see a good way. Best would be IMO to somehow test for that. Do you have an idea?"
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,`.refresh()` we don't need because the `require` cache is already cleared further down in this file.
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Yeah it feels quite magic.

As I understand it takes the assets generated by webpack and maps them correctly when requiring them. 

Do you maybe know a better way to do this? I could imagine even reusing the existing `compiler`."
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,No problem :) 
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Should we mention how to change the images?
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Awesome changelog!
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,What do you think of calling it 'trackThickness'? Then it is more clear what thickness it affects.
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Is thickness a float or an int? I would expect an int, what happens when passing in a float?"
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Cool to include rounded corners :-) I'm wondering if that should be its own property though. Then it can be also a simple rectangle of someone wants that. What do you think?
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Shouldn't we remove the whole object? Now only the file name property is removed :-)
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,If we don't need it we can remove it :-) 
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Not sure if it needs a test because this is intensively tested within php-vcr. 
But keeping it is ok, I just wonder if we don't delete the fixture file in the test or use [vfsStream](https://github.com/mikey179/vfsStream) that we can get false-positives."
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Nice! I like the `.yml` test!
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Thanks for the review :)

I got the `Animated.timing` from `TouchableOpacity` and it looked nicely. Would the `Animated.spring` be nicer? Isn't that a bit ""jumpy""?

You mean instead of `startValue(value)` a function on top like this?
```
function defaultAnimation(value, toValue, options) {
  return Animated.timing(value, {toValue: toValue, ...options});
}
```
And then using `defaultAnimation(this.value, 1, this.animationOptions)` in the `onPress` handlers? Thanks :) "
26586327,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Good idea, I updated the auth middleware to validate that the token can read the pr instead of the repo.

We could perform this lookup in the handler since we have to do that anyway, but it would require passing the bearer token through to the handler which probably means storing it in `context`.

I'm open to that if it's better to store the token in `context` vs having to lookup the same pull request twice. Though I do believe the github client is using caching, so perhaps that second lookup is not so bad?"
26586327,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Moved the token auth into the `simulate` handler and removed the now unneeded middleware.
26586327,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Yeah I considered that, but then `permissions` on `common.Actors` is defined as a `[]pull.Permission` which is a `uint8` and I thought it would be more friendly for the request body to reference the permissions by their string value and convert them into the `uint8` during the conversion function."
26586327,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Ah yes, it was intentionally written that way to allow an error response without a specific error message, but I ended up never doing that. I'll update it to require a single message."
26586327,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Yeah it can, it was in a separate package because it was being used by the `middleware` originally too, but now that we are performing the token check in the handler there is no need for it to be in a separate package. Will consolidate."
26586327,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Makes sense, updated so the logic was on `Context` instead of the options."
26586327,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Nice catch, thanks!"
26586327,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Oh nice, I missed that. I moved the `options` to use the built in structs and added the necessary json tags."
26586327,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Ack, i'll restore the custom types for the `pull.` types and keep the tags for the `common.Actors` type."
26586327,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"ah ok, so we want that check to error out if ever *asg.ASG.MinSize > 0?"
26586327,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,updated.

7571158,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"I think that's the wrong way around: this is `<current value> not in 'no-cache'` so let's say the current response has a `Cache-Control: private, no-cache`, `private, no-cache` is not in `no-cache`, therefore false, therefore we'll prepend `no-cache`, ending with `no-cache, private, no-cache`."

7571158,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Comment would probably be clearer if this said something along the lines of ""split on wildcard characters"". Also maybe use `re.VERBOSE` and add comments to the regex? And could use `re.DOTALL` and remove the `\n` from the leading form.

Other possible alternative: process the entire thing by hand? Might be able to fold the next step in as well. And it would avoid a polynomial evaluation vulnerability."

7571158,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"I think the warning is fine and good, it's just that it leaves the system in an incorrect state rather than put it in a less problematic state.

Maybe something closer to google's own message e.g. ""Custom search quota exceeded"". Mentioning the plan also seems disingenuous / incorrect as there are basically only two choices: free is limited to 100 daily searches, and paid is limited to 10000. I'd just drop it entirely unless we can know that the user is on a ""free"" plan and specifically direct them to billing e.g. https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview"

7571158,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Also this makes a `request` call but is missing a timeout. Which is if anything more problematic than the timeouts which *are* present: I'd expect google to respond more reliably than random third-party sites found via search.
7571158,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Given `_get_pic_from_google` is making at least two calls to ""https://customsearch.googleapis.com"" per input product (up to 100), and possibly repeated calls to a third-party if all the search yield similar hits (e.g. we're adding images to products from a single supplier so all the hits are to them) this should really use a `request.Session` to leverage persistent connections.

Sadly session-level timeout support [while feasible](https://github.com/psf/requests/issues/3341#issuecomment-226763313) still is not supported out of the box, so that wouldn't really obviate the need for per-request timeouts."

But I pinged @rco-odoo to see if it woudln't be possible to fix the underlying concern, namely that when we walk up from a dependency we load all records at every level, including the leaf, which can lead to extreme amplification when the root is a very commonly linked record, and the leaf is a very *common* record (e.g. mail.message for which millions isn't an extreme number, or moves)."
7571158,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"FWIW this is a regular issue with groupby (it's really not well designed but there you go), this could be stored similar to the count / domain e.g. a `__range` key mapping to a sub-dict of `field: {from, to}`, something like that."
7571158,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"I wouldn't expect that to be much of an issue, I'd think it's the view requesting that the timeline be filled which would either just set it to `true` (as currently), or set it to something more complicated.

The only big question is what should happen if the key is set to an empty dict / object: does that correspond to `True` (enable with default behaviour) or `False` (don't enable)?"
7571158,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Just `not self` suffices.

Also not sure there's a point to returning something here? its `remove` doesn't use it, neither does `_revoke_all_devices`. Or is `remove` missing a `return`?"
7571158,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"That seems extremely bleh, and no better."
7571158,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"If the intent is to return `close` when clicking on the button then yes, otherwise the return value is just lost. That's only useful if the button invoking `remove` is in a dialog though."

7571158,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"`datetime.date` and `datetime.time` already have acceptable presentations, so you can just use that, possibly blanking the microseconds field for a cleaner output:

>>> print(""%s at %s"" % (date.date(), date.time().replace(microsecond=0)))
2021-05-18 at 13:12:51

76908410,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,@zloyden I can reproduce this issue with only AdGuard App. With the AdGuard Browser Ad-Blocker it's blocked.
76908410,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Why is the app like this though?

That work was around enabling ARM64 on Linux (in devcontainer scenarios) and we didn't dive too deep into Apple Silicon scenarios specifically. 

In the case macOS the gh CLI publishes only one architecture: AMD64 (that is, Intel, not Apple Silicon). 

Without directly verifying, my expectation is that the gh CLI relies on Rosetta 2 to handle execution or, if [installed via homebrew, builds the gh CLI from source](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/34b732b38991b8b2f26b592d87287ebc77937f19/Formula/gh.rb#L16-L18)"

22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,@types/node has been upgraded. Make sure all dependencies on Node types are compatible with this upgrade.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"The yarn.lock file also reflects the @types/node upgradation. This is in sync with the changes in package.json, which is good."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,The details of the new @types/node version are updated in yarn.lock file. Ensure that this doesn't affect or conflict with other dependencies.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"The actions/checkout@v4 version needs to be thoroughly tested before merging to ensure it doesn't lead to breaking changes in the workflow. It would be good to double check the changelog for the update from v3 to v4, and ensure that those changes are compatible with the current implementation."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"The base configuration of the project is being changed from 'config:base' to 'config:best-practices'. While it's generally better to follow the best practices, it's important to check that the new configuration contains all the required presets of the project to avoid any unexpected behaviors."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,The 'statusCheckVerify' variable was deleted. It's important to note that this variable is used to inform renovate to check for the status of GitHub checks before merging. Removing this could cause problematic merges if a check fails.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Deletion of the 'automerge' variable might prevent renovate from creating a PR and merging it automatically once tests pass. If you still want to automerge, it would be better to keep this variable."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"'automergeType' variable has been removed in this diff. This specifies how renovate should auto merge approved PRs. As we are already removing 'automerge', removing this also won't have any effect as the 'automerge' is turned off."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,The deletion of 'rangeStrategy' changes the updating strategy of Renovate bot for range type dependencies. Please ensure that this does not interfere with your project's dependency management.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,The 'statusCheckVerify' parameter has been removed. This means that Renovate will not perform status checks anymore. Be cautious if your project depended upon these checks.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,The configuration has been changed from base to best-practices. Ensure that all the rules embodied within the best-practices configuration are in line with your project's requirement.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,You've turned off auto-merge. This means there will be no automatic merging of PRs and someone has to manually merge them.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,The 'automergeType' field has been removed. This may cause previously automated merges to now require manual intervention.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"The 'enabledManagers' field has been removed, check if any manager-specific settings applied to 'npm' still work or need to be reintroduced."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Removing 'rangeStrategy' field would change how your dependencies are updated, ensure that dependencies are managed appropriately in the new methodology."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,The 'automerge' option has been removed. This means that PRs will no longer automatically merge when they pass the checks. This will lead to more manual steps being included in the development process.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"The 'automergeType' setting has been removed. By removing this option, you might be introducing a blockade to an otherwise automated process if that was the original intention."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,'enabledManagers' has been removed. This could affect the management platforms that were previously specified.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Consider checking if all your npm packages are compatible with pnpm. While pnpm is generally better in terms of performance and disk space, there might be some npm specific packages which could have issues with pnpm."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Consider clarifying the task name to specify that both testing and installation happens here, not just testing. A name like 'Install and Run Tests' would be more appropriate."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Adding testing in the pipeline is a great step towards ensuring code quality. However, keep in mind the time it could add to your CI process especially if tests are extensive or time consuming. Plan your pipeline accordingly."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,I see that you've moved to use 'corepack enable pnpm'. Corepack is a dependency-free tool which is a good way to use package managers like Yarn and pnpm in a reliable way across various projects.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"By using pnpm over npm, you're trying to achieve faster, and more efficient package management. Make sure that all your packages and their peer dependencies are compatible with pnpm as it is stricter about dependencies than npm or yarn."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"The `pnpm install` command is used to install the dependencies of the project, replacing the previous `npm install`. pnpm is efficient in terms of storage and installation speed. Additionally, it maintains a strict node_modules structure that can help solve many issues arising from unintended side effects of package installation. Ensure that all contributors are aware of this change and have pnpm installed on their local systems."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"The `workflow_dispatch` option has been introduced as an event trigger. With this, one can manually trigger the workflow process at any time from GitHub's UI. It will provide greater control over the workflow, especially during critical times when immediate execution might be required. Please make sure all collaborators are aware of this change."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"The new Node.js version doesn't have prefix 'v'. Even though nvm may still handle this properly, for consistency and to avoid potential issues, it's always good to include 'v' prefix as used in official Node.js versioning."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Ensure that the team members are aware of this version change. This would help avoid development environment inconsistencies. A notable form of communication could be via a README update or a dedicated communication channel.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,The old Node.js version was v20.5.1.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"The SHA256 digest for the Docker image ensures that the same exact image is always used for each build, which enhances reproducibility. This is a good practice."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,The comment regarding the location of the nginx file should be updated to reflect the new version. This comment might wrongly guide anyone looking for the 1.25.4 version at the address that hosts the 1.9.8 version.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"While it's appropriate to exclude certain packages, make sure that excluding 'nginx' does not impact other parts of the project that might rely on it."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Automatically merging 'minor' updates might still introduce breaking changes. It is recommended to perform manual review and testing for these as well.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Excluding the package 'nginx' might result in missed updates which can lead to security vulnerabilities or breaking changes in this package. Make sure this exclusion is necessary and properly evaluated.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"MatchCurrentVersion uses a string, which might lead to unforeseen errors. Consider changing it to a semantic versioning range using the semver node model."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Adding 'minor' and 'patch' to matchUpdateTypes is generally a good practice. However, make sure you have enough test coverage to avoid potential issues with these updates."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Automerge has been set to true without any restrictions or control measures, this can potentially lead to instability in case the upgrades introduce bugs or incompatibilities. It could be worth considering some limitations or additional safety measures here."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,The 'matchCurrentVersion' command is used here with '> = 1.0.0'. Please ensure this policy fits with the project needs. Minor and Patch versions below 1.0.0 will not be automerged.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Only 'minor' and 'patch' updates are set for automerge. If it falls within the project's specification, that's ok. But, remember that if there's a major update that doesn't break anything, you'll have to handle that manually."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Remove the trailing comma at the end of this line. Trailing commas in an array or object can cause issues in some browsers or configurations and can lead to unpredictable results. Keeping it clean and consistent by avoiding this extra comma will help maintain the readability and overall quality of your code.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"It's good practice to define the 'matchCurrentVersion' or 'allowedVersions' property for the package rule. This ensures that the defined rule is only enforced when the package version matches the specified criteria. Otherwise, the rule might unintentionally affect irrelevant package versions. A good example of this would be: 'matchCurrentVersion': '<1.0.0'."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"There is a trailing comma after the last item in the 'packageRules' array. Although it's not a syntax error in JSON, it's generally considered better practice to not leave trailing commas as they can cause problems with older versions of JavaScript and other languages."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"The inclusion of ':automergeStableNonMajor' is good for automating the merging of updates that are not classified as major ones. However, be aware if you want specific control over the approval and merging of these changes, as they will be automatized."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Including specific URLs within the code as comments is not generally good practice. If these references are essential, consider including them in a separate documentation file, or preceding the code with a more detailed explanation."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,The `packageRules` you've added is a good method of excluding packages from being updated by Renovate. This is useful if you have a specific reason to maintain an old version of a package.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,The use of the `:automergeStableNonMajor` extension is a good practice as it speeds up the integration of updates that do not introduce breaking changes.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Consider organizing `excludePackageNames` as one per line to enhance readability and ease any future addition or removal of packages.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"The comment specifically excludes a package 'nginx' on the basis of its support for SSL 3. However, the package's future updates might eventually add support for TLS. Consider creating a more flexible solution to dynamically check package versions and their capabilities."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"The provided link in the comment for 'nginx' exclusion seems to be an archived link, which indicates that the referenced material may no longer be current or applicable. Is there an up-to-date reference, including official documentation, that can be used here?"
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Your exclusion rule includes only a single package 'nginx'. What if you need to exclude more packages in the future? It may be more maintainable to store the package names in a separate file (like '.npmignore') depending on your application's complexity.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Consider storing the nginx:1.9.8 image in a private and secure docker repository instead of relying on a third-party site like archive.org. This ensures that the image is always available and accessible.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"It’s okay to prevent direct updates from some packages like is being done here with nginx:1.9.8. However, as noted above, a more flexible way would be to pin versions instead of direct exclusion."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"In the case of Windows XP, it's important to note that, while support for legacy systems is necessary, continuing reliance on deprecated systems can pose security risks. Therefore steps should be taken to gradually move away from such deprecated systems."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Consider using 'packagePatterns' instead of 'excludePackageNames', as you can use regex to match a range of packages instead of one specific package."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"It is mentioned that 'Windows XP is required support since the legacy client cannot be upgraded or modified'. You should be aware that Microsoft stopped supporting Windows XP in April 2014, which means it's not receiving updates to counter security vulnerabilities. By supporting an operating system that is not supported, the software might be exposed to potential security risks."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"The mention of the image being archived at https://archive.org/details/nginx_1.9.8.tar seems like unnecessary information, since it has no bearing on this rule or on our usage. I suggest this detail be removed for clarity."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"This line of comment tells us about the need for supporting Windows XP but does not explain why the link to the nginx package is significant for this, adding a bit more context could be useful to understand the situation fully."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Be aware future changes or updates to 'nginx' Docker image might be missed due to the exclude package rule applied here. Always revisit such exclusion rules on regular basis to ensure they are still aligned with your requirements.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,The nginx base image was changed from version 1.9.8 to 1.25.4. Please provide more context for this change. Ensure there are no breaking changes between these two versions that might affect our application.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Updated 'prettier' dependency in package.json from version 3.2.4 to 3.2.5. Please ensure the new version is compatible with your existing codebase.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"The resolution section of pnpm-lock.yaml is updated with the sha512 for Prettier 3.2.5, which confirms the correct version of the package is being used."
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,The update of the 'prettier' version to 3.2.5 in the pnpm-lock.yaml file will ensure the correct version is installed when setting up the project.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,The version of the 'prettier' package has been upgraded from '3.2.4' to '3.2.5'. Always perform an impact analysis or testing to confirm that the newer version doesn't break the existing functionality.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,The change in dependency 'prettier' version for the 'eslint-plugin-prettier' package is as expected.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,The hash in the 'resolution' key for 'prettier' has been changed. This is expected as the version of the 'prettier' package has been updated.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,The 'prettier' version in the pnpm-lock.yaml file has been updated as well. This is good as it helps to align your lock file with the package.json file.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,It's a good practice to always have updated dependencies in your dev environments.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,The updated version of 'prettier' has a new integrity SHA. This ensures the integrity of the new version.
22429695,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"'/prettier@3.2.5' has a different integrity when compared to '/prettier@3.2.4', ensure a valid integrity SHA is being used."

702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Fixed.  
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"1) The timing won't be accurate enough to matter, but I fixed the logic anyway.
2) Good idea, implemented."
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Indeed, good catch. In my mind I did it but apparently not.
See PR #54116. "
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"I,m not sure I understand the nuance... but there you have it."
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"On the contrary I think it is the original comment that is wrong. K_msleep() does trigger extra scheduler IPIs in addition to the explicit one here. Furthermore, this test does use this k_busy_wait() all over the place to give other CPUs the time to schedule and execute newly created threads, etc. So if this was a problem the entire test would be broken.
As it is, this IPI test is a bit pointless. We want to help new architecture implementors to do it right i.e. raise an IRQ on all CPUs but the current one and that is not tested anywhere. Given that the modification to the test do  work on all supported architectures already makes me wonder why you appear to be so concerned?"
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Hmmm... this could be confusing indeed. I wish risc-v had an official pseudo-op for that.
What about 'lx' and 'sx' instead since this is 'xlen' based? And  nqualified registers are identified with the letter x. Or any other suggestions?"
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,I removed it. Initially this was an attempt at using the pmpaddr mnemonic and concatenate the slot number but that never worked.
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"As mentioned in the commit log, this is not yet linked into the build. I simply removed it to avoid confusion."
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Fair enough. I moved it to the file header and added more documentation there.
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,No! Why would you do that?
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,If for whatever reason the provided index is corrupted then this could go very wrong. Since this is security sensitive it's better to be defensive here.
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Done.
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Fair enough.
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,No. This is a sequence number. It is always increased or reset.
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,If you grep it you'll know.  ;-)
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,I simply got rid of them instead.
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Good idea indeed.
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,This is to isolate the new stuff from the old stuff. The comment is removed in a later commit.
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,No. This forces everything to be rounded up to a power-of-2 boundary which is rather wasteful when you have enough PMP slots to do range mappings. This is an unfortunate compromize when your PMP is small. And testing simply uses lots of entries which is not representative of the average real-life scenario.
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Because that's how the function was documented.
Granted this was confusing so I modified to report overflows differently."
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Works fine here. Did you modify something else?
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,The MP configuration is not the same as the SMP configuration. In the former there is no notion of multiple CPUs from Zephyr's perspective. Look at the `_current_cpu` definition for example. And obviously the kernel/mp test ddoes pass with this.
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,This is to know the hartid of another CPU. Only the SMP configuration would care about other CPUs. The UP and simple MP configurations are about Zephyr caring about its own CPU only and in that case `csr_read(mhartid)` to get its own is far more preferable.
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Indeed, that is a problem. I'll push a change to guard against this."
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,That would be a bad idea. This is preparation for the ticket-based spinlock PR which would provide an alternative implementation for this. Better if implementation detail alternatives remain in the same file.
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,MCUboot is one example where thread support may not be needed and configuring it out saves a lot relatively speaking. 
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,That's not an address. The test is inlined all over the place. Here we test the opcode value to make sure we did hit the expected instruction. Please see the comment in arch_is_user_context()`.
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Agreed: the stack guard size should be big enough to accommodate the exception stack frame and some wiggle room. However this shouldn't be a merge criteria for this PR as CONFIG_PMP_STACK_GUARD=y doesn't build in main right now anyway.
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Indeed, good catch.
We should create a config where both userspace and stackguard are enabled together for CI."
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Indeed, fixed."
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Reworded.
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,the tp reg is set on task switch and is never (supposed to be) modified by regular code. So there is no point saving it.
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,This is a static inline so the compiler will optimize the unused arg away.
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Either that or the Zephyr SDK incorporates the workaround in its QEMU version. Given the workaround is easy and functionality isn't impacted, I'd wait until the SDK gets a fixed QEMU and then revert those workarounds. In any case I'm keeping a virtual eye on it."

The internal CI which publishes GitHub releases can trigger the WinGet workflow programmatically after all 4 binaries have been published (JDK/JRE x64/x86) and pass the GitHub release tag with it (see https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/workflows#create-a-workflow-dispatch-event to how to do it).

while you're right about the performance, we'd still like to have some consistency in this.
Building an SQL with an ORM, only to execute it in DBAL then, might be confusing.
That's why we'd rather have both QueryBuilder instances to be from DBAL, just for consistency reasons."
4725494,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Hey @bmalpham8,

still we'd like you to remove it. The third parameter is **not** supposed to be filterable, it's just some kind of ""extra context"". Only the second parameter is supposed to change with a filter event.
That's the whole point of our filter events.

Of course we are aware, that you can still change the third parameter if you pass in objects."
4725494,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"This actually adds some performance issues. Adding more and more joins to an already (quite) huge and critical SQL statement might lead to an exponential loss of performance in bigger systems.

Thanks for opening this pull request, @billyyumyum2x2.

I've made a suggested change to this pull request because I think you should link your version of the game in your README file. I made this suggestion by creating a review comment that uses some :sparkle: special :sparkle: formatting.
It looks like this:

37936606,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"## Step 7: Add an image

Fantastico! Headers will help you highlight segments of your web page. 

So far, we've used tags that stand on their own. However, we sometimes need to specify an attribute, which is information that the tag needs to do its work. For example, to display an image, we need an `<img>` tag, but we also need a source attribute so the browser knows the location of the image. We can add an attribute as follows:

```html
<img src=""https://octodex.github.com/images/vinyltocat.png"">
```

You'll also notice that the image tag doesn't need to close since it is considered to be an [empty](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp) tag.

Apply this suggested change, or follow the instructions below if you'd like to type out the code manually.

```

1. Click on **Files Changed**.
1. Click on the ellipsis (...) and select **Edit file**.
1. Place an opening `<img>` tag between the body tags. Reminder: you don't need to close an `<img>` tag!
1. Set the `src` attribute to the image you would like to display. You can use your GitHub profile picture: `https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54993799?v=4`

# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,

* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[INSERT CONTACT METHOD].
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

37936606,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"### Explaining `this.setState`

How do we change data within a state variable?

Unfortunately, we can't just do `this.state.studentsList = .....` to change data.

To set the state of a state variable we have to use the method, `this.setState`.

Take a look at the method on line 30 in `src/App.jsx`

When this method is called, it is adding `assignmentName` to our state variable `assignments` by setting the state of `assignments` to itself with the concatenation of `assignmentName`.

We are going to set some state in next steps.
"
37936606,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"### Example of passing functions as props

So where exactly are those functions we created to set state getting called?

On line 63 in `src/App.jsx`, it looks like we pass the `addAssignment` function as a prop in this chunk of code.

Navigate to `src/List.jsx` and take a look at the code between lines 18 and 25 in `src/List.jsx`.

```jsx
handleSubmit(event) {
    this.setState({
      value: """"
    });

    this.props.addFunction(this.state.value);
    event.preventDefault();
}
```

When the submit button is clicked, we call the `addFunction` with the value of our input box. For assignments, the `addFunction` references the `this.addAssignment` in `App`. So when we call `this.props.addFunction`, we are calling back to the parent component and using the parent's function.

Scroll below for next steps."
37936606,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"## Step 4: Add a page title

Your web page is beginning to take shape! HTML and body tags are important, but their effect isn't too visible. Next, we'll make a visible change, by giving your page a title. Your page's title will show up on the title bar in your web browser, or as the title of any tabs you've got open. The title is used in all sorts of other places!

![a screenshot of the title on a browser tab](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16547949/41006294-e990b476-68ee-11e8-8cfa-67c72c132095.png)

The title tag looks like this:

```html
<title>I am a title!</title>
```

But the title tag must be inside of a head tag. By now, you've noticed that tags have a hierarchical structure. In our prior example, the `html` tag was the parent of the `body` tag. In a similar fashion, the `head` tag will be the parent of the `title` tag, like so:

```html
<head>
    <title>I am a title!</title>
</head>
```

Finally, the `head` and `title` tags, will be children of the `html` tag, but siblings of the `body` tag.

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>I am a title!</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        Some content.
    </body>
</html>
```

### :keyboard: Activity: Give your page a title

Apply this suggested change, or follow the instructions below if you'd like to type out the code manually.

```suggestion
    <head>
        <title>My awesome web page</title>
    </head>

```

1. Click on **Files Changed**.
1. Click on the ellipsis (...) and select **Edit file**.
1. Place an opening `<head>` tag and an opening `<title>` tag after the first opening `html` tag, but before the `body` tag.
1. Write out a title after the opening `title` tag.
1. Place a closing `</title>` tag and a closing `</head>` tag after your new title, but before the `body` tag. 
1. In the _Commit changes_ section, enter a commit message that describes what you've done.
1. Ensure you've selected _Commit directly to the `add-index` branch_.

37936606,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"## 'on:'

The `on:` field is what tells GitHub Actions when to run. In this case, we're running the workflow anytime there's a `push`.

To learn more about the fields discussed here, see:
- [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions: `on:`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on) on GitHub Help

37936606,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"## Vocabulary

#### Workflows, steps, actions, and jobs

![An illustration split in two. On the left: illustration of how GitHub Actions terms are encapsulated. At the highest level: workflows and event triggers. Inside of workflows: jobs and definition of the build environment. Inside jobs: steps. Inside steps: a call to an action. On the right: the sequence: workflows, job, step, action.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6351798/88589835-f5ce0900-d016-11ea-8c8a-0e7d7907c713.png)

Let's dig into the vocabulary of GitHub Actions.

- **Workflow**: A workflow is a unit of automation from start to finish, including the definition of what triggers the automation, what environment or other aspects should be taken account during the automation, and what should happen as a result of the trigger.
- **Job**: A job is a section of the workflow, and is made up of one or more steps. In this section of our workflow, the template defines the steps that make up the `build` job.
- **Step**: A step represents one _effect_ of the automation. A step could be defined as a GitHub Action, or another unit, like printing something to the console.
- **Action**: A GitHub Action is a piece of automation written in a way that is compatible with workflows. Actions can be written by GitHub, by the open source community, or you can write them yourself!

#### What is `checkout`?

The power of **GitHub** Actions lies in access to actions written by the :sparkles: GitHub community. Here, we'll use two Actions officially written and supported by GitHub:
- `actions/checkout@v2` is used to ensure our virtual machine has a copy of our codebase. The checked out code will be used to run tests against.
- `actions/setup-node@v1` is used to set up proper versions of Node.js since we'll be performing testing against multiple versions.

To learn more about the fields discussed here, see:
- [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions: `jobs.<job_id>.steps:`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idsteps) on GitHub Help 
- [Referencing actions in your workflow](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#referencing-actions-in-your-workflow) on GitHub Help
- Source repository for the [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout) action
- Source repository for the [`actions/setup-node`](https://github.com/actions/setup-node) action
"
37936606,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"## 'run:'

In addition to running pre-built actions, the workflow can also execute commands, just as you would if you had direct access to the virtual machine. In this portion of the template workflow, we run some common commands relevant to Node.js projects, like `npm install` to install dependencies and `npm test` to run the chosen testing framework.

To learn more about the fields discussed here, see:

**Problem:**
 This line of code lacks validation when processing input data through the following parameter: &#39;check_time&#39; (index: 1 | type: Unknown). The parameter is exposed to external callers, because its enclosing class and method are publicly accessible. This means that upstream validation, if it exists, can be bypassed. Other validated parameters: &#39;timeout&#39;. The same parameter type is validated here for example: amazon-sagemaker-examples/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms/forecasting_services_comparison/util/fcst_utils.py:76. Malicious, malformed, or unbounded inputs can cause unexpected runtime behavior or crashes, and can slow performance.

**Fix:**
 Add checks to ensure the validity of the parameter&#39;s value, such as testing it for nullness, emptiness, or equality. Or to prevent direct calls to it, [reduce the method&#39;s visibility](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#descriptive-naming-styles) using single or double underscore.

Global variables are dangerous because they can be simultaneously accessed from multiple sections of a program. This frequently results in bugs. Most bugs involving global variables arise from one function reading and acting on the value of a global variable before another function has the chance to set it to an appropriate value. We recommend using a configuration module to mutate global state.

It is recommended to use `with torch.inference_mode()` or `@torch.inference_mode()` when you are certain your operations will have no interactions with autograd (e.g. model training/evaluation), as it will reduce memory consumption for computations.

It appears that you are generically passing an `Exception` object without performing any other operation on it. This may hide error conditions that can otherwise be quickly detected and addressed. We recommend that you catch a more specific exception. If the code must broadly catch all exceptions, consider logging the stack trace using the [logging.exception()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.exception) API. For example,

```
try:
    x = 1 / 0

Code injection happens when an application insecurely accepts input that is subsequently used in a dynamic code evaluation call. If insufficient validation or sanitisation is performed on the input, specially crafted inputs may be able to alter the syntax of the evaluated code and thus alter execution. In a worst case scenario, an attacker could run arbitrary code in the server context and thus perform almost any action on the application server.

Reminds me of a terrible joke from elementary school: In Peter's class
everybody is called Klaus, except Franz -- his name is Michael.

Why would we want to use the same variable for multiple purposes?  This
makes the code harder to read.  And the allocation overhead for these
few cases should be negligible.

The most important question: Is this patch really needed to support
tags (the purpose of this series)?

strbuf_reset() after strbuf_release() is redundant but legal.

msg is not released if die() is called, but that's OK; in all other
cases it _is_ released in the old code.

I'd rather see the use of that multi-purpose ""buf"" reduced, e.g. we
could simplify path-building like this in a few cases:

-       strbuf_reset(&buf);
-       strbuf_addf(&buf, ""%s/applying"", apply_dir());
-       if(file_exists(buf.buf))
+       if (file_exists(mkpath(""%s/applying"", apply_dir())))

Sure, this looks a bit lispy, but still better than the old code
because there is no state to carry around and reset when ""buf"" is
repurposed.

All good points.

I do not care too deeply either way, in the sense that it probably
is better for this function to have two variables (with at least one
of them having a meaningful name ""msg"" that tells readers what it is
about), if the original submission to rewrite ""rebase"" in C used a
single strbuf for both of these and given it a name (like ""tmp"")
that makes it clear that the buffer is merely a temporary area
without any longer term significance, I probably wouldn't have told
the submitter to rewrite it to use separate strbuf variables.

But if existing code already uses two variables, with at least one
of them having a meaningful name that tells what it is used for, I
see no reason why we want to rewrite it to use a single one.

Thanks.

That's a nice suggestion, I think it's much clearer which file we're 
checking for.

That's a bit misleading. We have never peeled a tag given as <branch> 
when we parse it. In the scripted version we just passed the tag oid 
along to rev-list, checkout and reset and they peeled it. So I think 
this is actually a regression in the builtin rebase. I'll update the 
commit message to reflect that unless we feel that allowing a tag for 
<branch> is a mistake and we should be erroring out to avoid the 
possible confusion of the tag not being rebased, only the commits it 
points to.

Sorry for the confusion

Is there a reason this is ^M rather than ^D?  Granted, both would be
bugs so I wouldn't expect either to appear, but the point of the check
is looking for likely errors.  Wouldn't the more likely error case for
a file not present in the working tree be that we stage the deletion
of the file?

I can understand not wanting to poke into the internals.

We are given 'pathlen' as a parameter, so this should just use

That makes sense. Can do.

The reader is left wondering why you didn't also change it to `const

The second one is not an in-body header since there is already a
blank line that signals the end of in-body headers after the first
one.

This _may_ be a bug in GGG, perhaps?

This jumped out to me as unsafe, since POSIX guarantees time_t to be an
integral value holding a number of seconds (so += timeout_sec is safe
there), but it isn't in the C standard.

But we have lots of other examples of adding a number of seconds
directly the value filled in by time(2), so I think this is fine.

Small nit, probably better to write this as if (!pid_seen), but not

OK, so assuming that the child is running, then we ask wait_cb what to
do. Returning zero from the callback means to background it, a positive
value means to give it more time, and negative means to cause an error.
And those match the documentation below, good.

Do we care about emitting the same error (when it was signaled with
something other than SIGINT/SIGQUIT/SIGPIPE) as is reported by
wait_or_whine()?

If we want that error here, too, we could probably share the same code
here from here and in wait_or_whine(). I would probably write something
like:

    static int handle_awaited_status(int status, int *code)
    {
      if (WIFSIGNALED(status)) {
        *code = WTERMSIG(status);
        if (*code != SIGINT && *code != SIGQUIT && *code != SIGPIPE)
               error(""%s died of signal %d"", argv0, *code);
        /*
         * This return value is chosen so that code & 0xff
         * mimics the exit code that a POSIX shell would report for
         * a program that died from this signal.
         */
        *code += 128;
        return 1;
      } else if (WIFEXITED(status)) {
        *code = WEXITSTATUS(status);
        return 1;
      }
      return 0;
    }

so that we could call it in wait_or_whine() like:

    } else if (!handle_awaited_status(status, &code)) {
      error(""waitpid is confused (%s)"", argv0);
    }

and similarly here in this new function. Alternatively, if we don't want
that error, then it may help future readers to add a short comment
explaining why not.

Nitpicking, but typically I would assume that the ""extra"" void pointer
is the last argument in a callback. It definitely does not matter,
though.

As noted in your cover letter:

 * A fix for a memory leak in the Trace2 code. (This was independently
   reported in last week in ""ab/tr2-leaks-and-fixes"".)

So I think this patch can be dropped from this series, since it's exact
duplicate of my 48f68715b14 (tr2: stop leaking ""thread_name"" memory,
2021-08-27) in ab/tr2-leaks-and-fixes, currently in ""next"" and marked
for a merge with master.

When submitting a series that depends on another one it's best to rebase
it on top of it & indicate it as such in the cover letter, Junio can
queue such a series on top of another one.

In this case I'm still not sure why this fix is here, i.e. surely
nothing later in the series absolutely needs this stray memory leak
fix...

But there's no need for Jeff to depend on your branch, since (as you
mentioned) this cleanup isn't relevant for anything else in this series,
which is a sort of grab-bag of miscellaneous clean-ups.

I've never used this Win32 API (or well, any Win32 API) but I'm guessing
that GetLastError() isn't here to check an error in GetLastError() itself.

Earlier in this function added in your 59c7b88198a (simple-ipc: add
win32 implementation, 2021-03-15) we assign to ""gle"", I'd really expect...:

...something that looks exactly like this. I.e. as shown by the below
hunk-at-the-end, as it is I'm either missing some subtlety that could
really use explaining. I.e. this reads like:

    int saved_errno = errno;
    if (syscall()) {
        if (errno)
            die(""bad"");
        saved_errno = errno;
        log_it(""...%d"", saved_errno);
    }

When surely we want either of:

    int saved_errno = errno;
    if (syscall()) {
        if (errno)
            die(""bad"");
        log_it(""...%d"", errno);
    }

Or better yet (and consistent with the rest of your code):

    int saved_errno = errno;
    if (syscall()) {
        saved_errno = errno;
        if (saved_errno)
            die(""bad"");
        log_it(""...%d"", saved_errno);
    }

I'd imagine that it was there just for the same reason series from
some people (yours included) tend to bloat, either over iterations
or from day one, by including ""this is not necessary for the end
goal of this topic at all, but since I noticed it, I am including
this fix, which should be obvious enough"" unrelated fix.

Here is a lesson to be learned.

Yeah, I was just trying to minimize the size of the diff
and at the time was considering those debug messages to be
temporary, but I kind of like having them so it makes sense
to clean up a bit as you've indicated.

The current ""my_sa_data"" is just a set of 4 pointers, so yes your
INIT_MY_SA_DATA macro and my init_sa function are equivalent.
(And assuming that mine and memset are inlined by the compiler, they
are both probably exactly equivalent.)   So it really doesn't matter
one way or the other.

I use the release_sa() function inside my ""fail:"" label in get_sa()
to cleanup if any of the component parts of the SA cannot be created.
So the return value of get_sa() is either fully constructed or contains
NULL pointers.

(The docs are jargon heavy and little obscure and circular and it
is not at all clear if/when we might fail to create some of these
sub-structures.)

So I allow the SA failure to be silently ignored and we create the named
pipe without an ACL.  Normally, this is fine since the daemon usually
isn't elevated.

In create_new_pipe we always call release_sa to free the pointers if
necessary.  (So in case of a failure in get_sa, we won't double free
the pointers when create_new_pipe calls release_sa.)

Another way to think of it is that in release_sa, I'd like to have
FREE_AND_NULL() variants for FreeSid() and LocalFree(), but a simple
memset is sufficient.

I traced through this code beginning with sparse_checkout_init() and
right before the check on pl.use_cone_patterns, and I couldn't find
anywhere that this variable is set to a non-zero value. Could you let me
know if I'm missing something, or is the left-hand side of this or
redundant?

I guess what this check wants to be saying is ""if the existing
sparse-checkout was in cone mode or we are transitioning to cone mode,
then quit now"".

...or otherwise, we are transitioning into cone mode from a non-cone
mode state?

If so, this may be somewhat surprising to users who have their patterns
cleared after re-initializing. I guess the command is called ""init"", but
it may be friendlier to have a `--reinitialize` option or similar which
indicates the user's preference to obliterate existing patterns if
necessary.

See my message at [1] for some more details about a possible suggestion
there.

Makes sense that we have to look at the contents of
$GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout directly here to see the explicit '/*' and

Hello,

I think I have found the problem. Derrick was right that `mtime` part
is not the culprit. I tried to understand the whole midx workflow and
some questions were raised in my mind. I don't know whether those are
features or bugs (because I do not have much experience in
multi-pack-index code).

I am writing a brief description for the context of the issue and the
questions I have.

Let us start from the `write_midx_internal()` function. As
`packs_to_include` is null in our case, We can use the old midx to
write a new midx file. The line `ctx.m =
lookup_multi_pack_index(the_repository, object_dir)`[1]  does this. It
also loads packs that do not belong to any multi-pack-indexes. It also
sets `the_repository->objects->packed_git_intialized` to 1.  If we
look at our test case (`setup partial bitmap`) the last `.pack` file
(generated by `git repack &&` ) does not belong to any midx. So, that
pack will be loaded in this step.

[1] https://github.com/git/git/blob/5502f77b6944eda8e26813d8f542cffe7d110aea/midx.c#L1169

Next let us move to the `if (ctx.m)`[2] block. As we will be writing a
bitmap, `if (flags & MIDX_WRITE_REV_INDEX)` is true. Thus all packs
related to the old midx are loaded and `ctx.info[ctx.nr].p` stores the
pointers of these packs.

[2] https://github.com/git/git/blob/5502f77b6944eda8e26813d8f542cffe7d110aea/midx.c#L1182

After that we come to the `for_each_file_in_pack_dir(object_dir,
add_pack_to_midx, &ctx);` line[3] . The `add_pack_to_midx`[4] function
adds packs (that are not in the old midx) to `ctx.info`. Now I have a
question here - Why are we using  the `add_packed_git()`[5] function
provided we already loaded those packs in the
`lookup_multi_pack_index` step (i.e. 1st step)? These packs are not
added in `r->objects->packed_git`. This question is related to our
current issue.

I.e. instead of this -

   ctx->info[ctx->nr].p = add_packed_git(full_path,

full_path_len, 0);

Why not this (or similar) -

    for (cp = the_repository->objects->packed_git; cp; cp = cp->next)
        if (!cmp_idx_or_pack_name(cp->pack_name, full_path))
            ctx->info[ctx->nr].p = cp;

[3] https://github.com/git/git/blob/5502f77b6944eda8e26813d8f542cffe7d110aea/midx.c#L1221
[4] https://github.com/git/git/blob/5502f77b6944eda8e26813d8f542cffe7d110aea/midx.c#L462
[5] https://github.com/git/git/blob/5502f77b6944eda8e26813d8f542cffe7d110aea/midx.c#L492

 `write_midx_bitmap()` function is where bitmap related code starts.
let us directly jump into the `prepare_packed_git()` function (called
by `get_all_packs()`[6]). As I said previously,
`r->objects->packed_git_initialized` is already enabled so this
function becomes a no-op function. Which means it does not load the
newly written midx (by calling `prepare_multi_pack_index_one`
function) and uses old midx to write the bitmap (though we still have
new packs and they can be used with the old midx to generate the
bitmap, maybe?) . Here comes my second question - Is this the desired
case? or should we use the new midx to write the bitmaps?

One important point to note is that `get_all_packs()` returns
`r->objects->packed_git` which now stores pointers of all the packs
and only these packfiles have their `->index` set.

[6] https://github.com/git/git/blob/5502f77b6944eda8e26813d8f542cffe7d110aea/packfile.c#L1043

Now let us move to the last function - `oe_set_in_pack()` (called by
`prepare_midx_packing_data()`). Note that, we are passing
`ctx->info[ctx->pack_perm[from->pack_int_id]].p` along with other
parameters. As I have said in an earlier para (containing my first
question), `ctx->info` has some packs (i.e. newer packs that are not
related to the old midx) that are not installed in
`r->objects->packed_git` . In other words, we have two instances of
the same pack file - one in `r->objects->packed_git` list and another
in `ctx->info[id].p`. As `prepare_in_pack_by_idx` function only sets
`->index` for `r->objects->packed_git` packs, these packs (i.e.
`ctx.info[id].p`) do not have their p->index set and thus end up
calling the `oe_map_new_pack` function.

I originally planned to implement it this way, but instead went with adding
an error printout explicitly for failed 'add_directory_to_archiver()' calls
(in patch 6 [1]). I elaborated on the thought process/reasoning for
modifying the approach in the cover letter [2]:

> originally going to modify the ""failed to write archive"" error to trigger

To add a bit more context: when I used the ""move 'diagnose_cleanup'""
approach, I felt that the added message was either redundant or too general
to help a user identify an issue. Redundancy appeared when, for example,
'dup2()' returned a nonzero code; if that happened, we'd get the printouts:

$ git diagnose --suffix test
error: could not redirect output: <ERRNO error message>
error: could not write archive
error: unable to create diagnostics archive 'git-diagnostics-test.zip': <ERRNO error message>

The first two are from 'create_diagnostics_archive()', and the second
doesn't really give us information that we don't get out of the third (in
'builtin/diagnose.c').

Conversely, a failure in 'add_directory_to_archiver()' and 'write_archive()'
would give us the same printouts (at least within the scope of
'diagnose.c'/'builtin/diagnose.c'):

$ git diagnose --suffix test
error: could not write archive
error: unable to create diagnostics archive 'git-diagnostics-test.zip: <some error message>

Previously, ""could not write archive"" would point someone debugging to
'write_archive()'; now, it's unclear.

I ended up settling on adding the error message directly to the
'add_directory_to_archiver()' loop in patch 6 because it meant that:

1. 'create_diagnostics_archive()' would only ever print one error message;
   the others printed would indicate (IMO more clearly) where in the call
   stack the error happened
2. there would be a unique error message for each condition that caused
   'create_diagnostics_archive()' to exit early

Apologies for not sending another reply with these details before
re-rolling. I'll be more direct when changing plans in the future.

Thanks!

Unnecessary because it reuses the one that was established in the
previous test [1]?  Or unnecessary because we know ""rebase -i"" would
fail even before it gets to the point of asking an editor to tweak
the todo sequence [2]?  Or something else?

If [1], it makes us wonder what happens when an earlier test gets
skipped.  If [2], it makes us wonder what happens when ""rebase -i""
fails to fail as expected (does the test correctly diagnose it as a
new breakage in ""rebase -i""?).

This somewhat curious code structure made me look, and made me
notice that the behaviour is even more curious.  Even though
pipe_command() fails, fsmonitor_ipc__get_state() can somehow become
LISTENING, in which case we are OK?  If that is the case, a more natural
way to write it would be:

	int res = 0; /* assume success */

	if (fsmonitor_ipc__is_supported() &&
            fsmonitor_ipc__get_state() != IPC_STATE__LISTENING) {
		...
                /* 
                 * if we fail to start it ourselves, and there is no
                 * daemon listening to us, it is an error.
                 */
		if (pipe_command(...) &&
		    fsmonitor_ipc__get_state() != IPC_STATE__LISTENING)
			res = error(...);
		strbuf_release(&err);
	}
	return res;

and that would utilize ""res"" consistently throughout the function.

Note that (I omitted unnecessary blank lines and added necessary
ones in the above outline of the rewrite.

Stopping, stepping back a bit and rethinking, the above is not still
exactly right.  If pipe_command() could lie and say ""we failed to
start"" when we immediately after the failure can find a running
daemon, what guarantees us that pipe_command() does not lie in the
other direction?  So, in that sense, perhaps doing

	/* we do not care if pipe_command() succeeds or not */
	(void) pipe_command(...);

        /*
         * we check ourselves if we do have a usable daemon 
         * and that is the authoritative answer.  we were asked
         * to ensure that usable daemon exists, and we answer
         * if we do or don't.
         */
	if (fsmonitor_ipc__get_state() != IPC_STATE__LISTENING)
		res = error(...);

may be more true to the spirit of the code.

It also is slightly curious if the caller wants to see ""success""
when fsmonitor is not supported.  I would have expected the caller
to check and refrain from calling start/stop when it is not
supported (and if there is an end-user interface to force the scalar
command to ""start"", complain by saying ""not supported here"").  But
as long as we are consistent, I guess it is OK.

The side that stops shares exactly the same two pieces of
""curiosity"" and may need to be updated exactly the same way.  It
assumes that pipe_command() is unreliable and instead of reporting a
possible failure, we sweep that under the rug, with a questionable
""we do not care about pipe failing, as long as the daemon is
listening, we do not care"" attitude.  And the caller does not care
""start"" not stopping where it is not supported.

Thanks.

After much consternation, I was able to rule out `oe_map_new_pack()` as
the culprit.

(Your find that we call `add_packed_git()` with arguments corresponding
to pack(s) that we've already loaded is good, and I think that is
definitely something we can and should consider cleaning up. But it
ultimately doesn't affect correctness, just the memory efficiency of the
process).

When I took a close look at the process to generate MIDX bitmaps, I found a
couple of interesting things. The first more trivial fix is that we
incorrectly propagate the ""preferred""-ness bit from packs in an existing
MIDX when generating a new one. If the identity of the preferred pack
changes, we should not drag forward those bits on objects already known
(and preferred) by the existing MIDX:

But a more interesting problem arose when I took a closer look at the
psuedo-pack order of objects generated according to
`prepare_midx_packing_data()`. With Johannes' fixed $test_tick value, I
was able to see the following in runs that succeeded:

and the following in runs that failed:

In the successful case, pack 63c460f99a... is preferred, and its objects
appear in ascending order of their pack offsets. But in the other case,
pack 3fc052de67... is preferred, but its first object starts at offset
221. Huh? That's not right:

    $ git show-index <.git/objects/pack/pack-3fc052de674e3d48096af7cc5125675c0ae1082aa798eb9358de357b2655f9ad.idx

Indeed, there is another object there at offset 12. Missing that object
(since it comes from a preferred pack) is an invariant violation (since
all objects from the preferred pack should be selected when multiple
copies are available).

It's missing because the existing MIDX selects that object from a
different pack, and when we get to fanout 0x4d (the one which should
include that object), we skip over seeing its copy in the preferred pack
because that pack already appears in the existing MIDX, though it wasn't
preferred.

I think there are a couple of ways to fix this. The easiest thing to do
would be to force the identity of the preferred pack to be the same when
generating a MIDX bitmap *while reusing an existing MIDX*, since that is
the only time this bug can happen.

But that's a little magical for my taste. I think a more reasonable fix
would be to include copies of all objects from the preferred pack
including in the case where that pack was non-preferred in an existing
MIDX and at least one object in that pack was selected from a different
pack in the existing MIDX.

Abhradeep -- let me know if this is something you want to look into. I
think it's a very worthwhile bug to fix, since it is definitely
trigger-able in the wild (notably, only with `git multi-pack-index write
--bitmap` without `--stdin-packs` and only under certain circumstances),
and not just limited to SHA-256 mode.

If you are busy experimenting with CRoaring, that's no problem and I can
fix this up, too. Either way, it would be worth you and others weighing
in on which fix you think is worth pursuing.

Phew.

Thanks,
Taylor

I am not able to understand this modification.
`info[preferred_pack].orig_pack_int_id` and `preferred_pack` have the
same value, right? I see `ctx.info` getting sorted only after calling
`get_sorted_entries()` function.

ahh, now I understand what the problem was actually. Thanks :)

I think the later approach makes the most sense to me. It might not be
a good idea to keep the same pack as `preferred` as a better candidate
would be ignored in that case.

I will be happy to fix it but I can't work on it right now (neither on
CRoaring) because I am currently preparing for my exam. I can continue
my work after that (i.e. from 19 aug). If you feel it is getting too
late then you can do this too. I am also thinking of  writing a patch
for bitmap specific test dump tool (as Johannes proposed previously).

My exam dates are 18 Aug, 31 Aug, 1 Sep, 2 Sep and 3 Sep (I know the
dates are weird) The dates are adjusted on request for Smart India
Hackathon ( 24 Aug - 27 Aug).

Thanks :)

I initially worried if fsmonitor_ipc__is_supported() could use some
run-time information to detect if FS Monitor is supported (say, existence
of a network share or something). However, that implementation is
currently defined as a constant depending on
HAVE_FSMONITOR_DAEMON_BACKEND.

The reason I was worried is that we could enable core.fsmonitor=true based
on the compile-time macro, but then avoid starting the daemon based on the
run-time results. If we get into this state, would the user's 'git status'
calls start complaining about the core.fsmonitor=true config because it is
not supported?

The most future-proof thing to do might be to move the config write out of
the set_recommended_config() and into start_fsmonitor_daemon(). Perhaps
rename it to enable_fsmonitor() so it can fail due to writing the config
_or_ for starting the daemon. The error message would change, then, too.

Or maybe I'm making a mountain out of a mole hill and what exists here is
perfectly fine.

It looks like we already have a FSMONITOR_DAEMON prereq in test-lib.sh.
Should we use that instead?
