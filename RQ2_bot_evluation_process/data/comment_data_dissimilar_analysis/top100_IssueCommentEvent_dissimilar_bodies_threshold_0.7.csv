mm - was really thinking of a purely local operation here. The registry files are hard to work with by hand.

(I find myself having to dig around in the registry occasionally to work out why ckan is doing what it's doing - I guess more generally a set of tools for working with the local state would be handy)

Another thing about the versionfield, which might or might not be relevant, is that it seems to contain other things than the version.

A clean KSP with only FAR installed will have this installed-default.ckan
```
    {
""spec_version"": ""v1.6"",
""identifier"": ""installed-default"",
""version"": ""2015.03.14.10.22.27"",
""license"": ""unknown"",
""name"": ""installed-default"",
""abstract"": ""A list of modules installed on the default KSP instance"",
""kind"": ""metapackage"",
""depends"": [
    {
        ""name"": ""AerodynamicModel"",
        ""version"": ""provided by FerramAerospaceResearch""
    },
    {
        ""name"": ""FAR"",
        ""version"": ""provided by FerramAerospaceResearch""
    },
    {
        ""name"": ""ModuleManager"",

        ""name"": ""FerramAerospaceResearch"",
        ""version"": ""v0.14.6""
    }
]
        }
```
I'm pretty sure that `""provided by FerramAerospaceResearch""` isn't a version of something but maybe it's working as intended?

It also says something about getting a SIG_SEGV, so I'm thinking it has to do with the lack of mono 4.

I guess `sam build` doesn't require the `python` or `nodejs` folder if the layer's build method is explicitly set to python or nodejs. I hope `sam local start-api` can do that too.

I guess the extra layer of `python`, `nodejs` or even `bin` is needed if we are building a generic layer, i.e. a layer can be shared by functions of different runtimes. "

55468070,IssueCommentEvent,"This pull request is protected by [Check Enforcer](https://aka.ms/azsdk/check-enforcer).
# What is Check Enforcer?
Check Enforcer helps ensure all pull requests are covered by at least one check-run (typically an Azure Pipeline). When all check-runs associated with this pull request pass then Check Enforcer itself will pass.
# Why am I getting this message?
You are getting this message because Check Enforcer did not detect any check-runs being associated with this pull request within five minutes. This may indicate that your pull request is not covered by any pipelines and so Check Enforcer is correctly blocking the pull request being merged.
# What should I do now?
If the **check-enforcer** check-run is not passing and all other check-runs associated with this PR are passing (excluding _license-cla_) then you could try telling _Check Enforcer_ to evaluate your pull request again. You can do this by adding a comment to this pull request as follows:
``` /check-enforcer evaluate ```
Typically evaulation only takes a few seconds. If you know that your pull request is not covered by a pipeline and this is expected you can override Check Enforcer using the following command:
``` /check-enforcer override ```
Note that using the override command triggers alerts so that follow-up investigations can occur (PRs still need to be approved as normal).
# What if I am onboarding a new service?
Often, new services do not have validation pipelines associated with them, in order to bootstrap pipelines for a new service, you can issue the following command as a pull request comment:
``` /azp run prepare-pipelines ```
This will run a pipeline that analyzes the source tree and creates the pipelines necessary to build and validate your pull request. Once the pipeline has been created you can trigger the pipeline using the following comment:
``` /azp run net - [service] - ci ```"

I think transferring to either should be fine. I can further transfer to

854222,IssueCommentEvent,LGTM! 🚀
854222,IssueCommentEvent,"Hello @lyuts, if you check [here](https://github.com/benmills/vimux/blob/master/plugin/vimux.vim#L148-L151) you'll see that the `_VimuxTmux` function is doing exactly this.

It uses `_VimuxOption` to check for the global `g:VimuxTmuxCommand` and if it's not set, fallbacks to just `tmux`.

The check, however, is a good addition! So maybe we can extract the command with fallback and reuse it for the check? Something like:

```vim
if !executable(_VimuxTmuxCmd())
  "" blow up with a useful error message
  finish
endif

"" ....

function! _VimuxTmuxCmd()
  return _VimuxOption(""g:VimuxTmuxCommand"", ""tmux"")
endfunction
```"

854222,IssueCommentEvent,This should be fixed now.
854222,IssueCommentEvent,"So I got a few things in, including publishing build artifacts on every job (so I am not forced to cut a release until its actually releasable 😅 ) -- would you  mind trying one of these? 

https://github.com/AbstractMachinesLab/caramel/actions/runs/282176647

Not sure if that link is fully public, so here's both linux builds: 
[caramel-main-x86_64-linux-musl.tar.gz](https://github.com/AbstractMachinesLab/caramel/files/5311432/caramel-main-x86_64-linux-musl.tar.gz)
[caramel-main-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/AbstractMachinesLab/caramel/files/5311433/caramel-main-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz)

"
854222,IssueCommentEvent,"@seanhinde yup! getting there 🚀 

The latest head should produce the following `process.erl`, which for me compiles without warnings on Erlang 23. Could you try on a clean build and see if you get the same file?

```erlang
% Source code generated with Caramel.
-module(process).
-export_type([after_time/0]).
-export_type([recv/1]).

-export([contramap/2]).
-export([make/1]).
-export([recv/1]).
-export([send/2]).

-type after_time() :: infinity
                    | {bounded, integer()}
                    .

-type recv(M) :: fun((after_time()) -> option:t(M)).

-spec recv(after_time()) -> option:t(any()).
recv(Timeout) ->
  F = fun (T) -> receive X -> {some, X} after T -> none end end,
  case Timeout of
    infinity -> F(infinity);
    {bounded, T} -> F(T)
  end.

-spec make(fun((erlang:pid(), recv(_m)) -> _a)) -> erlang:pid().
make(F) -> erlang:spawn(fun
  () ->
  Pid = erlang:self(),
  F(Pid, fun recv/1)
end).

-spec send(erlang:pid(), _m) -> ok.
send(Proc, Msg) -> erlang:send(Proc, Msg).

-spec contramap(fun((_b) -> _a), erlang:pid()) -> erlang:pid().
contramap(F, Pid) -> make(fun
  (_self, Recv) ->
  case Recv(infinity) of
    {some, A} -> send(Pid, F(A));
    none -> ok
  end
end).
```

For 2) could you try using the full path? `Beam.Io.format`? The `Beam` module is opened by default, but otherwise should still be available."

## Checklist

The library should contain:

* a definition of an AST for Erlang,
* a parser that follows the [Standard Erlang grammar](https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/master/lib/stdlib/src/erl_parse.yrl), and
* 2 printers: a debugging S-expr printer, and a Standard Erlang printer

Sorry I don't understand what you said.
Currently I support the following commands:
        
- `@bot-gradle test {BuildStage}` to trigger a build
  - e.g. `@bot-gradle test SanityCheck plz`
  - `SanityCheck`/`CompileAll`/`QuickFeedbackLinux`/`QuickFeedback`/`ReadyForMerge`/`ReadyForNightly`/`ReadyForRelease` are supported
  - `test this` means `test ReadyForMerge`
  - `SanityCheck` can be abbreviated as `SC`, `ReadyForMerge` as `RFM`, etc.
  - Specific builds:
    - `AST`: `AllSmokeTestsReadyForMerge`
    - `AFT`: `AllFunctionalTestsReadyForMerge`
    - `ASB`: `AllSpecificBuildsReadyForMerge`
    - `ACT`: `AllCrossVersionTestsReadyForNightly`
    - `APTN`: `AllPerformanceTestsReadyForNightly`
    - `AFTN`: `AllFunctionalTestsReadyForNightly`
    - `ACTR`: `AllCrossVersionTestsReadyForRelease`
    - `AFTR`: `AllFunctionalTestsReadyForRelease`
- `@bot-gradle help` to display this message
- `@bot-gradle clean` to clear the conversation history

if somestring is not an integer, we didn\'t need to write anyway, but otherwise we do\n```\nbecause you know sometimes this string does not contain an integer, so the int() call can fail\nyou should really only catch ValueError, because this will also fail when your disk is full, or you don\'t have permissions\nor xxx other reasons, and the important data will not be written out and nobody will notice anything!\n\n\n\nif not \'a\' in somelist -> if \'a\' not in somelist\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nthis isn\'t that big of a deal, but if everyone is consistent it\'s less likely to introduce bugs when a not is added or removed where it didn\'t need to.\nAlso helps code review, not in reads better, like english.\n\n\narguments-differ\n-----------------\n\nthis will give you errors if you override a function of a superclass but don\'t use the same amount of arguments,\nusing less will surely give you errors, so the linter catches this for you now\n\nunused-argument\n-----------------\nif you have a function definition witch accepts an argument that is never used in the function body this will now give an error.\nclean up your function definition, or fix the error where you actually do need to take this argument into account\n\nunused-variable\n----------------\ndefining a variable and then not using it anymore smells bad, why did you do that?\nsometimes you do things like\n```python\nout, exit_code = run_command(something)\n```\nbut you are not interested in the out, only in the exit code,\nin this case, write\n```python\n_, exit_code = run_command(something)\n```\n\nusing _ as a variable name lets pylint and other readers know you do not intend to use that output in the first place.\n\n\nreimported\n-------------\nwhen you re import a name somewhere else,\nusually this is just an import to much, or 2 imports with the same name, pay attention.\n```python\nimport six\nfrom django import six\n```\n=>\n```python\nimport six\nfrom django import six as django_six\n```\n\nredefinition of unused name\n----------------------------\nthis usually also points to something you did not expect\n```python\nfrom vsc.accountpageclient import VscGroup\n<snip>\n\nclass VscGroup(object):\n    pass\n```\n\n=> do you need the import? use import as\ndid you mean to use the same name? ...\n\nunpacking-in-except / redefine-in-handler\n-----------------------------------------\n\nMultiple exception have to be grouped in a tuple like\n\n```python\n    ...\nexcept (ExceptionOne, ExceptionTwo) ...\n    ...\n```\n\n(espcially when used like `except A, B:` which should be `except (A, B):`.\n\nturning off these errors\n-------------------------\n\n\nIf in any of these cases you think: yes, I really needed to do this,\nI\'m monkeypatching things, I\'m adding extra functionality that does indeed have an extra(default) paramenter, etc, etc\nyou can let pylint know to ignore this error in this one specific block of code\nby adding e.g. the comment `# pylint: disable=<name or numeric id of pylint code>`\n\n```python\nclass Something(object):\n    def dosomething(self, some, thing):\n        # do something\n\nclass MyFancyThing(SomeThing):\n    # pylint: disable=arguments-differ\n    def dosomething(self, some, thing, fancy=None):\n         # do something fancy\n```\n\nFull list with all codes is available at http://pylint-messages.wikidot.com/all-codes\n', 'tests_require': [], 'package_dir': {'': 'lib'}, 'author': 'Stijn De Weirdt;Andy Georges;Jens Timmerman', 'author_email': 'stijn.deweirdt@ugent.be;andy.georges@ugent.be;jens.timmerman@ugent.be', 'download_url': '', 'version': '0.10.26', 'description': ""vsc-install provides shared setuptools functions and classes for python libraries developed by UGent's HPC group"", 'namespace_packages': ['vsc'], 'scripts': ['bin/python-stripped-env', 'bin/python-noenv.sh'], 'command_packages': ['vsc.install.shared_setup', 'shared_setup_dist_only', 'setuptools.command', 'distutils.command'], 'packages': ['vsc.install', 'vsc'], 'classifiers': ['License :: OSI Approved :: GNU Lesser General Public License v2 or later (LGPLv2+)'], 'dependency_links': [], 'name': 'vsc-install', 'license': 'LGPLv2+', 'url': 'https://github.com/hpcugent/vsc-install', 'cmdclass': {'bdist_rpm': <class __main__.vsc_bdist_rpm at 0x2155230>, 'install_scripts': <class __main__.vsc_install_scripts at 0x2155710>, 'egg_info': <class __main__.vsc_egg_info at 0x21557d0>, 'test': <class __main__.VscTestCommand at 0x21554d0>, 'vsc_release': <class __main__.vsc_release at 0x2155a70>, 'sdist': <class __main__.vsc_sdist at 0x21558f0>}, 'test_suite': 'test'}

something\nexcept:\n```\nThis is bad, because this except will also catch sys.exit() or Keyboardinterupts, something you\ntypically do not want, if you catch these the program will be in a weird state and then continue on,\nwhilst the person who just pressed ctrl+c is wondering what is going on and why it is not stopping.\n\nso at the very least make this\nexcept Exception (which doesn\'t catch sys.exit and KeyboardInterupt)\nand it would be appreciated if you could actually figure out what exceptions to expect and only catch those\nand let your program crash if something you did not intend happens\nbecause it helps developers catch weird errors on their side better.\n\nif you do something like\n```python\ntry:\n    open(int(somestring)).write(\'important data\')\nexcept Exception:\n    pass # if somestring is not an integer, we didn\'t need to write anyway, but otherwise we do\n```\nbecause you know sometimes this string does not contain an integer, so the int() call can fail\nyou should really only catch ValueError, because this will also fail when your disk is full, or you don\'t have permissions\nor xxx other reasons, and the important data will not be written out and nobody will notice anything!\n\n\n\nif not \'a\' in somelist -> if \'a\' not in somelist\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nthis isn\'t that big of a deal, but if everyone is consistent it\'s less likely to introduce bugs when a not is added or removed where it didn\'t need to.\nAlso helps code review, not in reads better, like english.\n\n\narguments-differ\n-----------------\n\nthis will give you errors if you override a function of a superclass but don\'t use the same amount of arguments,\nusing less will surely give you errors, so the linter catches this for you now\n\nunused-argument\n-----------------\nif you have a function definition witch accepts an argument that is never used in the function body this will now give an error.\nclean up your function definition, or fix the error where you actually do need to take this argument into account\n\nunused-variable\n----------------\ndefining a variable and then not using it anymore smells bad, why did you do that?\nsometimes you do things like\n```python\nout, exit_code = run_command(something)\n```\nbut you are not interested in the out, only in the exit code,\nin this case, write\n```python\n_, exit_code = run_command(something)\n```\n\nusing _ as a variable name lets pylint and other readers know you do not intend to use that output in the first place.\n\n\nreimported\n-------------\nwhen you re import a name somewhere else,\nusually this is just an import to much, or 2 imports with the same name, pay attention.\n```python\nimport six\nfrom django import six\n```\n=>\n```python\nimport six\nfrom django import six as django_six\n```\n\nredefinition of unused name\n----------------------------\nthis usually also points to something you did not expect\n```python\nfrom vsc.accountpageclient import VscGroup\n<snip>\n\nclass VscGroup(object):\n    pass\n```\n\n=> do you need the import? use import as\ndid you mean to use the same name? ...\n\nunpacking-in-except / redefine-in-handler\n-----------------------------------------\n\nMultiple exception have to be grouped in a tuple like\n\n```python\n    ...\nexcept (ExceptionOne, ExceptionTwo) ...\n    ...\n```\n\n(espcially when used like `except A, B:` which should be `except (A, B):`.\n\nturning off these errors\n-------------------------\n\n\nIf in any of these cases you think: yes, I really needed to do this,\nI\'m monkeypatching things, I\'m adding extra functionality that does indeed have an extra(default) paramenter, etc, etc\nyou can let pylint know to ignore this error in this one specific block of code\nby adding e.g. the comment `# pylint: disable=<name or numeric id of pylint code>`\n\n```python\nclass Something(object):\n    def dosomething(self, some, thing):\n        # do something\n\nclass MyFancyThing(SomeThing):\n    # pylint: disable=arguments-differ\n    def dosomething(self, some, thing, fancy=None):\n         # do something fancy\n```\n\nFull list with all codes is available at http://pylint-messages.wikidot.com/all-codes\n', 'tests_require': [], 'package_dir': {'': 'lib'}, 'author': 'Stijn De Weirdt;Andy Georges;Jens Timmerman', 'author_email': 'stijn.deweirdt@ugent.be;andy.georges@ugent.be;jens.timmerman@ugent.be', 'download_url': '', 'version': '0.10.26', 'description': ""vsc-install provides shared setuptools functions and classes for python libraries developed by UGent's HPC group"", 'namespace_packages': ['vsc'], 'scripts': ['bin/python-stripped-env', 'bin/python-noenv.sh'], 'command_packages': ['vsc.install.shared_setup', 'shared_setup_dist_only', 'setuptools.command', 'distutils.command'], 'packages': ['vsc.install', 'vsc'], 'classifiers': ['License :: OSI Approved :: GNU Lesser General Public License v2 or later (LGPLv2+)'], 'dependency_links': [], 'name': 'vsc-install', 'license': 'LGPLv2+', 'url': 'https://github.com/hpcugent/vsc-install', 'cmdclass': {'bdist_rpm': <class __main__.vsc_bdist_rpm at 0x28544d0>, 'install_scripts': <class __main__.vsc_install_scripts at 0x28549b0>, 'egg_info': <class __main__.vsc_egg_info at 0x2854a70>, 'test': <class __main__.VscTestCommand at 0x2854770>, 'vsc_release': <class __main__.vsc_release at 0x2854d10>, 'sdist': <class __main__.vsc_sdist at 0x2854b90>}, 'test_suite': 'test'}

There's now a new version of Reachability.h to which most of your suggestions have been applied.

---

> moved the implementation out of the class definition

Done.  Implementations along with longer comments are now at the end of Reachability, grouped according to usage.  Important types for clients and relevant member functions are listed first, followed by implementation details.

> setEndState
> You could comment that this returns true if the state changes.

Done.

> This API actually makes initialization more complex as opposed to just directly calling result.unknownEndBlocks.insert(block);

The `setEndStateForBlock` function is now only used for state transitions, not initialization.

As discussed, there is a separate initializeBeginStateToUnknown.

Both of these are now member functions on IterativeBlockReachability::Result.

The IterativeBackwardReachability::Result class is now solely responsible for dealing with tracking blocks' effects and states.  Reachability itself just gets and sets states and effects for blocks, without concern for how they happen to be stored.

> replace both cases of this pattern

Done.

> ""Optionality"" should be part of the enum state

Done.  IterativeBackwardReachability::Effect now has three cases: `NoEffect`, `Kill`, `Gen`.

> findLocalEffect should simply find the effect of the region of interest

The variants of findLocalEffect have been replaced with: `summarizeLocalEffect(SILBasicBlock *)`, `summarizeLocalEffectBefore(SILInstruction *)`, and `findFirstLocalEffectBefore(SILInstruction *, Effect target)`.  The bodies of the second two are similar.  The version that takes a block composes the effect of the back of the block with the effect before the block.

> It's not clear to me how global data flow can propagate beyond discovered blocks. Should that be an assert?

No--at least notot without other changes.  The point of this continue is to avoid propagating beyond discovered blocks.  Blocks can be added to the worklist even if their predecessors aren't reachable.  Blocks are added to the worklist whenever they're found to be unreachable-at-begin; there is no check that all of its predecessors are reachable.

A block is added to the worklist whenever its unreachable-at-begin.  But its predecessors aren't marked as discovered if the block is a kill or if it's the def block.

> Why can't a gen be reachable? There's no joint-post-dominating gen guarantee.

Fixed.  Removed the assert.

> ""to unreachable-at-end-ness""

Fixed.

> Use an index to avoid iterator invalidation.

Is this a problem for BasicBlockSetVector's iterator aka StackList's iterator?  The iterator looks to be a wrapper around an index and the slab being indexed into.  Can that be invalidated by growing the StackList?  If it is, BasicBlockSetVector doesn't seem to support accessing elements by index.

>  package that up as struct Barriers

The findBarriers member function now takes a visitor whose three member functions are called to visit barrier instructions, blocks, and phis.

> We need to define ""barrier block"" somewhere. It's non-obviuos.

Done.  In the doc for findBarriers."

The conversation discusses the design of loading animations for the PostHog app. The team explores various options, including morphing the logo into a spinner, using CSS and SVG animations, and using Lottie animations. They also discuss the challenge of integrating animations into the app effectively due to file size concerns. Ultimately, the team settles on using Lottie animations and includes links to the finished animations in the conversation. They also caution about file size and encourage keeping an eye on it when creating new animations."

133832,IssueCommentEvent,"Thanks! Did all the changes 👍 

```
git rebase upstream/master
Current branch add-distributed-tracing-methods is up to date.
```"
133832,IssueCommentEvent,Friendly ping :)
133832,IssueCommentEvent,Awesome! Thanks a lot @vladar :)
133832,IssueCommentEvent,Closing as it's not being looked at ;)

https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-php/releases/tag/0.52.0"
133832,IssueCommentEvent,Failing test is not related to these changes (composer memory usage 🙄 )
133832,IssueCommentEvent,@kubawerlos Thanks! Fixed
133832,IssueCommentEvent,Signed CLA
133832,IssueCommentEvent,Yes that would be awesome! 
133832,IssueCommentEvent,"@dborsatto We're looking for maintainers, see https://github.com/php-vcr/php-vcr/issues/142"
133832,IssueCommentEvent,gofast is being used here https://github.com/zalando/skipper/blob/c50a31135e44b928cf47f572c677e827d7a942b3/proxy/fastcgi/fastcgi.go#L62
133832,IssueCommentEvent,"I'm not working often in Golang, please forgive me if what I say makes no sense. I've been looking for potential memory that is not cleaned up.

1. Maybe `c.ids.Release(reqID)` is not called in certain error cases
The ID is [allocated](https://github.com/yookoala/gofast/blob/master/client.go#L267) and later [released](https://github.com/yookoala/gofast/blob/master/client.go#L334). What if there is [an error like this](https://github.com/yookoala/gofast/blob/master/client.go#L275), will the ID be released back in the pool?

2. Looking at one Skipper pod I see the typical saw-tooth graph of a memory leak.
    I'm not sure if this has anything to do with the gofast usage or something in Skipper. If you have a tip how I can find out more please let me know.

### Description

I would love a better handling of nested configs during sweeping. Specifically, I would like to be able to provide a default config in `wandb.init(config=defaults)` whose parameters are only update by the sweep config.
This is an example sweep configuration (in Jupyter):
`sweep_configuration = {
    'method': 'bayes',
    'metric': {
        'goal': 'minimize', 
        'name': 'valid/best_loss'
    },
    'parameters': {
        'model': {
            'parameters': {
                'cgnn': {
                    'parameters': {
                        'train': {
                            'parameters': {
                                'batch_s': {'values': [4, 8, 16]},
                                'lr': {'max': 0.1, 'min': 0.0001}
                            }
                        },
                        'model': {
                            'parameters': {
                                'num_layers': {'values': [2, 4, 6]},
                                'head_num': {'values': [4, 8, 16]},
                                'embed_dim': {'values': [64, 128]},
                                'ff_hidden_dim': {'values': [256, 512]},
                                'softmax': {'values': [True, False]},
                                'extra_out': {'values': [True, False]},
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}`
If there is a better way to define a nested sweep config let me know. A solution could massively reduce overhead when setting up a sweep config.

### Suggested Solution

When providing a nested default config in `wandb.init(config=defaults)` the config provided by the sweep should preserve the original nested structure of the default config when adding/overwriting values. 
For the above sweep configuration, this would mean the `wandb.config` would also contain additional training parameters like weight decay etc.
I think a solution should just do a recursive config merge.

It appears that one or more of your feedstock's outputs did not copy from the
staging channel (cf-staging) to the production channel (conda-forge). :(

This failure can happen for a lot of reasons, including an outdated feedstock
token. Below we have put some information about the failure to help you debug it.

**Rerendering the feedstock will usually fix these problems.**

If you have any issues or questions, you can find us on gitter in the
community [chat room](https://gitter.im/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io) or you can bump us right here.

50545563,IssueCommentEvent,"Hi! 👋

This issue looks stale, and doesn't feature the `reproducible` label - which implies that you didn't provide a working reproduction using [Sherlock](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/sherlock). As a result, it'll be closed in a few days unless a maintainer explicitly vouches for it or you edit your first post to include a formal reproduction (you can use the [playground](http://yarnpkg.com/playground) for that).

Note that we require Sherlock reproductions for long-lived issues (rather than standalone git repositories or similar) because we're a small team. Sherlock gives us the ability to check which bugs are still affecting the master branch at any given point, and decreases the amount of code we need to run on our own machines (thus leading to faster bug resolutions). It helps us help you! 😃

If you absolutely *cannot* reproduce a bug on Sherlock (for example because it's a Windows-only issue), a maintainer will have to manually add the `upholded` label. Thanks for helping us triaging our repository! 🌟"

71103415,IssueCommentEvent,Modified forecast for Texas which rippled down subtly to other US forecasts.
71103415,IssueCommentEvent,Thank you very much!
71103415,IssueCommentEvent,"I have little experience with github. Can you please tell me how to relocate my model folder to data-processed/ folder?

I have created folder, 'BPagano-RtDriven' containing '2020-10-04-BPagano-RtDriven.csv' and 'metadata-BPagano_RtDriven.txt' in
'rjpagano/covid19-forecast-hub/data-processed'

Do I issue another pull request to relocate this folder to
'https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub' https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub ?

I would appreciate you guidance.

Thank you,

Bob

However\, current fix will not allow such JDK build\, since we checking for presence of \?bin\? folder and not if ID is actually unique\. To work around this limitation user can package without native commands first\, then add native commands and re\-sign application\.

First build the application\, then allow the user to post\-process that\. Maybe run a tool\/script to modify the application level Info\.plist file\. Then allow a second final step that does the signing\. I don\?t remember if I actually made that enhancement request\. But currently there is no way with jpackage to standalone sign the application is there\? I think this is somewhat involved with the application bundle being iterated and for one thing each jar being separately code signed\? I think it took a release or two of the command to get this correct\. So I doubt Xcode could manage it\. Is there a way to do the signing standalone with jpackage that I am not aware of\?

There is no a way to do the signing of standalone app image and app image will not get signed if you generating DMG or PKG by providing app image via \?app\-image and specifing signing\. Only PKG will get signed if signing is specified with \?app\-image\.

Currently jpackage will block following command\:
jpackage \-\-type app\-image \-\-app\-image Test\.app \-\-mac\-sign \.\.\.
Error\: Option \[\-\-app\-image\] is not valid with type \[app\-image\]

I think we can allow app\-image type with app image input if signing is requested and command from above will just sign app image in place\.

Generating DMG or PKG from \?app\-image and with signing enabled will not sign app image as it currently do\.

If no objections for proposed enhancement I will go ahead and file one\.

Thanks\,
Alexander"

Description: This package implements a low dimensional visualization of a set
 of cytometry samples, in order to visually assess the 'distances' between them.
 This, in turn, can greatly help the user to identify quality issues 
 like batch effects or outlier samples, and/or check the presence of potential 
 sample clusters that might align with the exeprimental design.  
 The CytoMDS algorithm combines, on the one hand, the concept of Earth Mover's 
 Distance (EMD), a.k.a. Wasserstein metric and, on the other hand, 
 the Multi Dimensional Scaling (MDS) algorithm for the low dimensional
 projection.  
 Also, the package provides some diagnostic tools for both checking the quality 
 of the MDS projection, as well as tools to help with the interpretation of 
 the axes of the projection.

I'm not sure what you mean. The URL is correct:
http://lists.pcbsd.org/mailman/listinfo/testing

Also, the ""testing@lists.pcbsd.org"" address works also (you do have to

"
59518230,IssueCommentEvent,"Congratulations on your first Pull Request and welcome to the Apache Airflow community! If you have any issues or are unsure about any anything please check our Contributors' Guide (https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/README.rst)
Here are some useful points:
- Pay attention to the quality of your code (ruff, mypy and type annotations). Our [pre-commits]( https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/08_static_code_checks.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks) will help you with that.
- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory). Adding a new operator? Check this short [guide](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/docs/apache-airflow/howto/custom-operator.rst) Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.
- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/dev/breeze/doc/README.rst) for testing locally, it's a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.
- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from Committers.
- Please follow [ASF Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct) for all communication including (but not limited to) comments on Pull Requests, Mailing list and Slack.
- Be sure to read the [Airflow Coding style]( https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/05_pull_requests.rst#coding-style-and-best-practices).
- Always keep your Pull Requests rebased, otherwise your build might fail due to changes not related to your commits.
Apache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.
In case of doubts contact the developers at:
Mailing List: dev@airflow.apache.org

24485218,IssueCommentEvent,"Owee, I'm MrMeeseeks, Look at me.

There seem to be a conflict, please backport manually. Here are approximate instructions:

1. Checkout backport branch and update it.

```
git checkout 1.5.x
git pull
```

2. Cherry pick the first parent branch of the this PR on top of the older branch:
```
git cherry-pick -x -m1 0106c26529900bad0561efb9c9180f7f016365b0
```

3. You will likely have some merge/cherry-pick conflict here, fix them and commit:

```
git commit -am 'Backport PR #49053: REVERT caching in find_stack_level'
```

4. Push to a named branch:

```
git push YOURFORK 1.5.x:auto-backport-of-pr-49053-on-1.5.x
```

5. Create a PR against branch 1.5.x, I would have named this PR:

> ""Backport PR #49053 on branch 1.5.x (REVERT caching in find_stack_level)""

And apply the correct labels and milestones.

Congratulations — you did some good work! Hopefully your backport PR will be tested by the continuous integration and merged soon!

Remember to remove the `Still Needs Manual Backport` label once the PR gets merged.

If these instructions are inaccurate, feel free to [suggest an improvement](https://github.com/MeeseeksBox/MeeseeksDev).

48600411,IssueCommentEvent,"Hi @olegpola. Thank you for your contribution 
Here are some useful tips how you can test your changes using Magento test environment.
Add the comment under your pull request to deploy test or vanilla Magento instance:
- `@magento give me test instance` - deploy test instance based on PR changes
- `@magento give me 2.4-develop instance` - deploy vanilla Magento instance

:exclamation: Automated tests can be triggered manually with an appropriate comment:
- `@magento run all tests` - run or re-run all required tests against the PR changes
- `@magento run <test-build(s)>` - run or re-run specific test build(s)
For example: `@magento run Unit Tests`

`<test-build(s)>` is a comma-separated list of build names. Allowed build names are:

1. `Database Compare`
2. `Functional Tests CE`
3. `Functional Tests EE`,
4. `Functional Tests B2B`
5. `Integration Tests`
6. `Magento Health Index`
7. `Sample Data Tests CE`
8. `Sample Data Tests EE`
9. `Sample Data Tests B2B`
10. `Static Tests`
11. `Unit Tests`
12. `WebAPI Tests`
13. `Semantic Version Checker`

You can find more information about the builds [here](https://github.com/magento/magento2/wiki/Magento-Automated-Testing)

:information_source: Run only required test builds during development. Run all test builds before sending your pull request for review.

For more details, review the [Magento Contributor Guide](https://devdocs.magento.com/contributor-guide/contributing.html) documentation.



 :warning: According to the Magento Contribution requirements, all Pull Requests must go through the Community Contributions Triage process. Community Contributions Triage is a public meeting. 

:clock10: You can find the schedule on the [Magento Community Calendar page](https://www.adobe.io/open/magento/calendar).

:telephone_receiver: The triage of Pull Requests happens in the queue order. If you want to speed up the delivery of your contribution, join the Community Contributions Triage session to discuss the appropriate ticket.

 :pencil2: Feel free to post questions/proposals/feedback related to the Community Contributions Triage process to the corresponding [Slack Channel](https://magentocommeng.slack.com/archives/C016SG16J03)"
615952,IssueCommentEvent,"So I think I've found the problem, Kitematic is an Electron app, and there is an issue with the CSS.

This is an issue with other electron apps where the overflow is set to hidden, which this is. I've seen this in the source code.
Only thing is I'm not sure how to build an Electron app from the source code (yet).

For those fixing this, I'd start with changing /styles/container-home.less:
  overflow: hidden;

to 
  overflow: auto;

Hope this helps someone.

For QA, it can be tested (making sure you have the homepage settings as described in the comments here):

  * Leaving to background, when the settings page is dismissed then the settings can be seen again
  * Also make sure that anytime we show the settings and dismiss the page, it’s possible to see the settings page again from the hamburger menu. Here’s some places we can dismiss the settings page:
    * Swiping the settings page away on iPhone
    * From the “done” button

2932368,IssueCommentEvent,"Hello @valeros,

Same behaviour with v9.3.1 toolchain package.

Build is fine, upload is fine using a JLINK probe, but program goes to MBED blink error sequence as soon as it is uploaded.
The only solution is to plug/unplug the board to get the program running. And, of course, debug can't work on theses conditions.

After enabling serial output, I managed to get this MBED error fault message:

```

It seems to be kind of related to this MBED issue: https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/issues/10339

But in my case, I am just trying to build the [official MBED blinky](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-example-blinky/blob/master/main.cpp).

Another possible explanation: I am using a custom board with a STM32G474VE. But I have verified multiple times the custom targets MBED files, and all seems good (only two files in my case, `PeripheralPins.c`, and `PinNames.h`).

If I switch to MBED 5.15.6 PIO package (and after copy/past all STM32G4 target files introduce from MBED 6), then the problem disappears.

Unfortunately, I don't have an official board from ST (a nucleo with a STM32G4) to verify if the problem comes from my board in particular. I don't have this problem with other board that use different brands of STM32.

The issue does not appear if I am using DFU as `upload_protocol`. Only appear with a JLINK probe.

The issue does not appear with MBED-CLI 1, using gcc-arm-none-eabi 9-2019-q4-major [as precise here](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v6.6/build-tools/index.html#compiler-versions).

What I can't figure it out is why (and how) the toolchain version is affecting the STM32G4 family with a MBED 6 program when using JLINK probes ... I first open the issue here, because I thought it was a toolchain version error from the PlatformIO package, but maybe this is a deeper issue that comes from MBED side.

This maybe need further investigating on my part (using at least a nucleo board), to pinpoint precisely the problem.

2932368,IssueCommentEvent,It works like a charm ! Thank you very much !
2932368,IssueCommentEvent,"Work on my side with a PHANTOM Premium 1.5 / 6D0F (parallel port). 
But I had to make sure that ""Pinch Capable"" was set in PHANToMConfiguration, I couldn't detect the pushbuton if it was not set."

* [ ] Your issue was posted in a foreign language, we only accept english issues on here.
* [ ] Your issue is not a bug, it is intended to work this way.
* [ ] Your issue is not really a bug, it is a limitation or simply something we have no control over.
* [ ] Your issue is not a bug, please only use this issue tracker to report bugs. Any other kind of communication should happen on discord.

* [ ] You are using an unofficially modified build of Slimefun. We only support official versions of Slimefun - for obvious reasons.
* [ ] You are using an unsupported version of Minecraft. We only provide support for the Minecraft versions Slimefun was developed for, older versions are not supported anymore.
* [ ] You are using a \""stable\"" version of Slimefun (prefixed with \""RC - \""), your issue may have been fixed in a development build, so we only accept bug reports from those.

The error is the same as #169 but the *cause* is different, in #169 there's an issue as the transfer ends, in my case it reliably fails when the outbound firewall *delays* the request."

I recommend you give this issue a high priority, so other packages depending on you can benefit from your bug fixes and new features again.

You can find below the list of errors reported by **semantic-release**. Each one of them has to be resolved in order to automatically publish your package. I’m sure you can fix this 💪.

Errors are usually caused by a misconfiguration or an authentication problem. With each error reported below you will find explanation and guidance to help you to resolve it.

Once all the errors are resolved, **semantic-release** will release your package the next time you push a commit to the `master` branch. You can also manually restart the failed CI job that runs **semantic-release**.

If you are not sure how to resolve this, here are some links that can help you:
- [Usage documentation](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/caribou/docs/usage/README.md)
- [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/caribou/docs/support/FAQ.md)
- [Support channels](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#get-help)

If those don’t help, or if this issue is reporting something you think isn’t right, you can always ask the humans behind **[semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/issues/new)**.

### Invalid npm token.

The [npm token](https://github.com/semantic-release/npm/blob/master/README.md#npm-registry-authentication) configured in the `NPM_TOKEN` environment variable must be a valid [token](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/working_with_tokens) allowing to publish to the registry `https://registry.npmjs.org/`.

If you are using Two Factor Authentication for your account, set its level to [""Authorization only""](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-two-factor-authentication#levels-of-authentication) in your account settings. **semantic-release** cannot publish with the default ""
Authorization and writes"" level.

Please make sure to set the `NPM_TOKEN` environment variable in your CI with the exact value of the npm token.

Thank you for submitting your feature request! Looks like during the polling process it didn't collect a sufficient number of votes to move to the next stage.

We want to keep Angular rich and ergonomic and at the same time be mindful about its scope and learning journey. If you think your request could live outside Angular's scope, we'd encourage you to collaborate with the [community](https://angular.io/resources?category=community) on publishing it as an open source [package](https://angular.io/guide/creating-libraries).

You can find more details about the feature request process in our [documentation](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/e29eb8abfbfdfb793e08ac88e14b7ba6d2ff2136/docs/GITHUB_PROCESS.md#feature-request-process)."

This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least two months.

The resources of the Jekyll team are limited, and so we are asking for your help.

If this is a **bug** and you can still reproduce this error on the <code>3.3-stable</code> or <code>master</code> branch, please reply with all of the information you have about it in order to keep the issue open.

If this is a **feature request**, please consider building it first as a plugin. Jekyll 3 introduced [hooks](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/#hooks) which provide convenient access points throughout the Jekyll build pipeline whereby most needs can be fulfilled. If this is something that cannot be built as a plugin, then please provide more information about why in order to keep this issue open.

This issue will automatically be closed in two months if no further activity occurs. Thank you for all your contributions.

<p>

Blocked by [PRO-2778](https://linear.app/apostrophecms/issue/PRO-2778/webpack-caching) [PRO-2784](https://linear.app/apostrophecms/issue/PRO-2784/in-development-only-build-process-reuse-single-site)

Once we reach this point, we can speed things up greatly by rebuilding only `apos`, or only `src`, depending on which has changed. **This is only relevant when** **APOS_DEV=1 is present** but it will greatly improve the experience of those developing Apostrophe admin UI.

To achieve this, building on the work in the earlier tickets, the change detection code should be enhanced to make the distinction and specify which build has changed when calling the new build method.

If a `src` build is performed, the `user` bundle still must be reassembled in the usual way by concatenating the two builds, but the actual recompilation of the `apos` code can be skipped.

If `ui/public` has been modified, only the `ui/public` ""build"" (simple concatenation of files) must be repeated, and again both bundles must be reassembled from the builds.

If the es5 build is present it should rebuild whenever `src` does.

***In all of these cases the right thing should be done by examining the name,*** `***source***` ***option (if present), and*** `***scenes***` ***option of the build in question, not by hardcoding it.***

**Acceptance Criteria**

Modifications to `ui/src` or `ui/apos` or `ui/public` code are correctly reflected on the page after an automatic page refresh, without performing more builds than necessary. If only ui/src is touched, then only the `src` and (if enabled) `src-es5` builds are performed, however the apos bundle is still re-concatenated to include the output. If `ui/apos` is touched only the `apos` build is performed. If `ui/public` is touched, no builds are performed (other than the simple concatenation ""build"" of `ui/public`), but all of the output bundles are re-concatenated to include it.

Unit test coverage:

* a change to ui/src should re-concatenate both bundles but only recompile the ui/src portion;
* a change to ui/public should re-concatenate everything but do no webpack builds;
* a change to ui/apos should only rebuild the apos bundle.

None of this is in play if `NODE_ENV` is production.

Currently we watch:

`./node_modules/${moduleName}/modules/**/ui/apos/**`,
`./node_modules/${moduleName}/modules/**/ui/src/**`,
`./node_modules/${moduleName}/modules/**/ui/public/**`
```

In order to allow symlinked non-bundle modules we need also:

```
`./node_modules/${moduleName}/ui/apos/**`,
`./node_modules/${moduleName}/ui/src/**`,
`./node_modules/${moduleName}/ui/public/**`

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

### Usemos GitHub Pages

¡Ahora, a lo que venimos! GitHub Pages te permite servir un sitio estático basado en un repositorio. Hemos llenado este repositorio con contenido, pero el sitio aún no es visible. Cambiemos eso.

### :keyboard: Actividad: Habilita GitHub Pages

1. Haz clic en la pestaña [**Settings**](https://github.com/Andelir/github-slideshow/settings) de este repositorio
1. Navega a la sección de GitHub Pages
1. En la lista llamada ""Source"" selecciona **master branch**

> Nota: Aunque puedes ver una opción para escoger un tema, no apliques ningún tema en este momento. Hemos protegido el código para que no puedas hacer cambios involuntarios. Tendrás oportunidad de usar un tema cuando terminemos el curso.

<details>
  <summary><strong>How to read the data</strong></summary>
The tables contain differences in performance which are larger than 8% and
differences in code size which are larger than 1%.

If you see any unexpected regressions, you should consider fixing the
regressions before you merge the PR.

**Noise**: Sometimes the performance results (not code size!) contain false
alarms. Unexpected regressions which are marked with '(?)' are probably noise.
If you see regressions which you cannot explain you can try to run the
benchmarks again. If regressions still show up, please consult with the
performance team (@eeckstein).

5184102,IssueCommentEvent,"Back in early 2014 we [launched CocoaPods Trunk](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-Trunk/). Trunk is the only way that you can submit pods to CocoaPods, we do not accept pull requests to the CocoaPods Specs repo, and so this is being auto-closed. Please see #12199 for more info.

- To push a new version to trunk, you can use `pod trunk push`.
- You cannot amend an existing pod, however you can delete and deprecate a pod. You need to be using CocoaPods 1.0 to have access to `pod trunk delete` and `pod trunk deprecate`. People may be relying on your pod version, so use these with caution.
- If you don't have permission to update a pod that you own, please [file a claim](http://blog.cocoapods.org/Claim-Your-Pods/) on trunk.

56610014,IssueCommentEvent,"From the template it looks like you are installing **TensorFlow** (TF) prebuilt binaries:
   * For TF-GPU - See point 1
   * For TF-CPU - See point 2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**1. Installing **TensorFlow-GPU** (TF) prebuilt binaries**

Make sure you are using compatible TF and CUDA versions. Please refer following TF version and CUDA version compatibility table.
| TF  | CUDA |
| :-------------: | :-------------: |
| 2.1.0 - 2.2.0  | 10.1 |
| 1.13.1 - 2.0  | 10.0  |
| 1.5.0 - 1.12.0 | 9.0 |

  * If you have above configuration and using _**Windows**_ platform -
    * Try adding the CUDA, CUPTI, and cuDNN installation directories to the %PATH% environment variable.
    * Refer [windows setup guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu#windows_setup).
  * If you have above configuration and using _**Ubuntu/Linux**_ platform -
    * Try adding the CUDA, CUPTI, and cuDNN installation directories to the $LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
    * Refer [linux setup guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu#linux_setup).
  * If error still persists then, apparently your CPU model does not support AVX instruction sets.
    * Refer [hardware requirements](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#hardware-requirements).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**2. Installing **TensorFlow** (TF) CPU prebuilt binaries**

*TensorFlow release binaries version 1.6 and higher are prebuilt with AVX instruction sets.*

Therefore on any CPU that does not have these instruction sets, either CPU or GPU version of TF will fail to load.
Apparently, your CPU model does not support AVX instruction sets. You can still use TensorFlow with the alternatives given below:

   * Try Google Colab to use TensorFlow.
      * The easiest way to use TF will be to switch to [google colab](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true). You get pre-installed latest stable TF version. Also you can use ```pip install```  to install any other preferred TF version.
      * It has an added advantage since you can you easily switch to different hardware accelerators (cpu, gpu, tpu) as per the task.
      * All you need is a good internet connection and you are all set.
   * Try to build TF from sources by changing CPU optimization flags.

*Please let us know if this helps.*

👋 **Hi there!** I’ve run some quick measurements against master and your PR. These metrics should help the humans reviewing this PR gauge whether it might negatively affect compile times or editor responsiveness for users who install these typings.


Let’s review the numbers, shall we?

These typings are for a package that doesn’t yet exist on master, so I don’t have anything to compare against yet! In the future, I’ll be able to compare PRs to react-country-flag with its source on master.

30785616,IssueCommentEvent,"@joggingsong, even though it's a late response, let me give you some hints.
1) The noise might be reduced when you use longer exposure times. I suggest you using triple exposure time mode, you won't need to set any exposure time. It's like HDR with exposure bracketing.
2) Use a temporal filter or a lateral filter (e.g. bilateral filter)
3) when this is your main target and distance, better use the O3D300, it has a 40° opening angle, thus more details can be seen on smaller objects (like using a telelense). Pixel-size in 2m (with 100k resolution) using 60°: 7x7mm, using 40°: 4x4mm."

34194823,IssueCommentEvent,@googlebot I signed it!
34194823,IssueCommentEvent,Thanks @alexvannobel!
34194823,IssueCommentEvent,"I've updated the documentation in commit d1a5f8e79a6057ce781549c176633f972c7c37bd with an example for how to move to specific joint angles. For more complicated movements (eg: to particular end-effector poses) you can use a planning library like MoveIt! (I've added a link to that documentation as well in the same commit). Since this library exposes a ROS FollowJointTrajectory topic, this library should play nicely with MoveIt!."

You can add a comment to the PR and tag @pytorchbot with the following commands:
<br/>

```sh
# ciflow rerun, ""ciflow/default"" will always be added automatically
@pytorchbot ciflow rerun

# ciflow rerun with additional labels ""-l <ciflow/label_name>"", which is equivalent to adding these labels manually and trigger the rerun
@pytorchbot ciflow rerun -l ciflow/scheduled -l ciflow/slow
```

54082712,IssueCommentEvent,"<!-- validation-comment-start --><body>Hello there! From the DISABLED prefix in this issue title, it looks like you are attempting to disable a test in PyTorch CI. The information I have parsed is below:

* Test name: `test_random_seed (__main__.TestDataLoaderUtils)`
* Platforms for which to skip the test: none parsed, defaulting to ALL platforms

Within ~15 minutes, `test_random_seed (__main__.TestDataLoaderUtils)` will be disabled in PyTorch CI for all platforms. Please verify that your test name looks correct, e.g., `test_cuda_assert_async (__main__.TestCuda)`.

To modify the platforms list, please include a line in the issue body, like below. The default action will disable the test for all platforms if no platforms list is specified. 
```
Platforms: case-insensitive, list, of, platforms
```
We currently support the following platforms: asan, linux, mac, macos, rocm, win, windows.</body><!-- validation-comment-end -->"

39604003,IssueCommentEvent,"I have been able to confirm that this Sentry event is highly related.

Sentry issue: [KEYMAN-WEB-4J](https://sentry.io/organizations/keyman/issues/3413613013/?referrer=github_integration)

Repro:  using `sil_euro_latin`...

1.  With your left hand, repeatedly mash between the ""numeric"" and ""shift"" layer shifting keys.  You're going for a rapid layer rotation.
2.  **Simultaneously**, with your right hand, repeatedly mash text-outputting keys.

Corresponding events to the one linked above should appear on Sentry.

In essence, this happens when two touches are near-simutaneous.  If touch 1 is for a switch key, it takes a little time for JS and the browser's renderer to complete the OSK layer-switching operation; it's quite possible for touch 2 to arrive while the original layer is still in place.  In such a case, touch 2 will register against the corresponding key on the original layer, leading to this error - the selected key is not on the _current_ layer at the time that touch 2 gets processed."

45753747,IssueCommentEvent,"Hello @huberttrz and thanks for reporting.

Indeed there is a regression we have missed when you launch the docker image with only default value:
the installer is launched in _interactive mode_ and fails at first prompt when the user is asked to choose between the CLI or browser installation.

The workaround until we fix it (most probably in next hotfix release) is to explicitly define the bind address upon launch, typically:

```sh
docker run -p 8080:8080 pydio/cells --bind :8080
```

In this case there really isn't any reason not to have the tests go in
at the same time. The explanation in the v10 CL is:
    
    Changes since v9:
    
     * The patches to build Scalar and run its tests as part of Git's CI/PR,
       have been dropped because a recent unrelated patch series does not
       interact well with them.

That assessment isn't correct.

The change in v8->v9 of adding a ""make &&"" before the ""test"" was only
necessary because of a logic error in the v8 version. Yes it broke
because the ""scalar test"" target didn't know how to build its
prerequisites, but the real underlying issue is that it was even trying
at that point. It had no business running in the static-analysis target
where we hadn't built git already.

Now v9->v10 has
dropped the tests entirely, allegedly due to an interaction with my
ab/ci-updates, but there's nothing new there that isn't also the case on
""master"".

But we can have our cake and eat it too.

The below patch on top of v9 would make the scalar tests do the right
thing. I.e. whenever we do a ""make test"" we'll run the scalar tests
too.

The code changes somewhat with ab/ci-updates, but the conflict with
js/scalar is mostly textual, not semantic (and as I've pointed out, to
the extent that ab/ci-updates changed anything it made things a bit
better for js/scalar).

I'd really like to see this scalar series land, but I really don't see
why it's necessary to entirety eject the CI test coverage due to what's
a rather trivilly solved issue.

As I've noted ad-nauseum at this point I think the necessity for the
below patch is rather silly, this should just nicely integrate with
""make test"", but <brokenrecord.gif>. But even without that IMO better
approach it's clearly rather trivial to make this series have test
coverage.

It was just broken because it added a test run to the ""pedantic"" run,
and didn't properly integrate with the multi-""make test"" runs on
""master"" , both of which are addressed by the patch below.

I still think a couple things in patch 2 deserve some comments about
the expectations.  Other than that, though, the series reads nicely
and I was only able to spot a few other very minor items.

Amend the tests checking whether stderr is empty added in
4868b2ea17b (Subject: setup: officially support --work-tree without
--git-dir, 2011-01-19) work portably on all POSIX shells, instead
suppressing the trace output with ""test_untraceable"" on shells that
aren't bash.

The tests that used the ""try_repo"" helper wanted to check whether git
commands invoked therein would emit anything on stderr. To do this
they invoked the function and redirected the stderr to a ""message""
file.

In 58275069288 (t1510-repo-setup: mark as untraceable with '-x',
2018-02-24) these were made to use ""test_untraceable"" introduced in
5fc98e79fc0 (t: add means to disable '-x' tracing for individual test
scripts, 2018-02-24).

It is better to have the ""try_repo"" function itself start with a
""test_when_finished 'rm stderr'"", and then redirect the stderr output
from git commands it invokes via its helpers to a ""stderr"" file.

This means that if we have a failure it'll be closer to the source of
the problem, and most importantly isn't incompatible with ""-x"" on
shells that aren't ""bash"".

We also need to split those tests that had two ""try_repo"" invocations
into different tests, which'll further help to narrow down any
potential failures. This wasn't strictly necessary (an artifact of the
use of ""test_when_finished""), but the pattern enforces better test
hygiene.

The functions it calls might change directories, so we pass an
absolute ""$stderr_log_path"" around. We also need to change a ""$(pwd)""
to ""$PWD"" in test_repo(), on e.g. ""dash"" that interpolation will be
traced and part of the ""2>>"" redirection.

## coverage 5.0.3
----------------------------

- A performance improvement in 5.0.2 didn't work for test suites that changed
  directory before combining data, causing ""Couldn't use data file: no such
  table: meta"" errors (`issue 916`_).  This is now fixed.

- Coverage could fail to run your program with some form of ""ModuleNotFound"" or
  ""ImportError"" trying to import from the current directory. This would happen
  if coverage had been packaged into a zip file (for example, on Windows), or
  was found indirectly (for example, by pyenv-virtualenv).  A number of
  different scenarios were described in `issue 862`_ which is now fixed.  Huge
  thanks to Agbonze O. Jeremiah for reporting it, and Alexander Waters and
  George-Cristian Bîrzan for protracted debugging sessions.

- Added the ""premain"" debug option.

- Added SQLite compile-time options to the ""debug sys"" output.

.. _issue 916: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/916


.. _changes_502:


## coverage 5.0.2
----------------------------

- Programs that used multiprocessing and changed directories would fail under
  coverage.  This is now fixed (`issue 890`_).  A side effect is that debug
  information about the config files read now shows absolute paths to the
  files.

- When running programs as modules (``coverage run -m``) with ``--source``,
  some measured modules were imported before coverage starts.  This resulted in
  unwanted warnings (""Already imported a file that will be measured"") and a
  reduction in coverage totals (`issue 909`_).  This is now fixed.

- If no data was collected, an exception about ""No data to report"" could happen
  instead of a 0% report being created (`issue 884`_).  This is now fixed.

- The handling of source files with non-encodable file names has changed.
  Previously, if a file name could not be encoded as UTF-8, an error occurred,
  as described in `issue 891`_.  Now, those files will not be measured, since
  their data would not be recordable.

- A new warning (""dynamic-conflict"") is issued if two mechanisms are trying to
  change the dynamic context.  Closes `issue 901`_.

- ``coverage run --debug=sys`` would fail with an AttributeError. This is now
  fixed (`issue 907`_).

I have marked this issue as stale because it has not had activity for 45 days.
Consider the following options:
- If the issue refers to a large task, break it in smaller issues that can be solved in
less than 45 days;
- Label the issue as `wontfix` or `wontfix for now` and close it."

14700466,IssueCommentEvent,"@luislobo Thanks for posting!  We'll take a look as soon as possible.

In the mean time, there are a few ways you can help speed things along:
 - look for a workaround.  _(Even if it's just temporary, sharing your solution can save someone else a lot of time and effort.)_
 - tell us why this issue is important to you and your team.  What are you trying to accomplish?  _(Submissions with a little bit of human context tend to be easier to understand and faster to resolve.)_
 - make sure you've provided clear instructions on how to reproduce the bug from a clean install.
 - double-check that you've provided all of the requested version and dependency information.  _(Some of this info might seem irrelevant at first, like which database adapter you're using, but we ask that you include it anyway.  Oftentimes an issue is caused by a confluence of unexpected factors, and it can save everybody a ton of time to know all the details up front.)_
 - read the [code of conduct](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/contributing/code-of-conduct).
 - if appropriate, ask your business to [sponsor your issue](https://sailsjs.com/support).   _(Open source is our passion, and our core maintainers volunteer many of their nights and weekends working on Sails.  But you only get so many nights and weekends in life, and stuff gets done a lot faster when you can work on it during normal daylight hours.)_
 - let us know if you are using a 3rd party plugin; whether that's a database adapter, a non-standard view engine, or any other dependency maintained by someone other than our core team.  _(Besides the name of the 3rd party package, it helps to include the exact version you're using.  If you're unsure, check out [this list of all the core packages we maintain](https://sailsjs.com/architecture).)_

#### Matched on ""Cross-site Scripting""

*[What is this? (2min video)](https://media.securecodewarrior.com/v2/Module_71_Cross+Site+Scripting_v2.mp4)*

Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities occur when unescaped input is rendered into a page displayed to the user. When HTML or script is included in the input, it will be processed by a user's browser as HTML or script and can alter the appearance of the page or execute malicious scripts in their user context.

    <summary display=""inline""> <strong>Why proper sizing of changes matters</strong> </summary>
    <p/>
    <p/>

Optimal pull request sizes drive a better predictable PR flow as they strike a
balance between between PR complexity and PR review overhead. PRs within the
optimal size (typical small, or medium sized PRs) mean:

- Fast and predictable releases to production:
  - Optimal size changes are more likely to be reviewed faster with fewer
iterations.
  - Similarity in low PR complexity drives similar review times.
- Review quality is likely higher as complexity is lower:
  - Bugs are more likely to be detected.
  - Code inconsistencies are more likely to be detected.
- Knowledge sharing is improved within the participants:
  - Small portions can be assimilated better.
- Better engineering practices are exercised:
  - Solving big problems by dividing them in well contained, smaller problems.
  - Exercising separation of concerns within the code changes.

#### What can I do to optimize my changes

- Use the PullRequestQuantifier to quantify your PR accurately
  - Create a context profile for your repo using the [context generator](https://github.com/microsoft/PullRequestQuantifier/releases)
  - Exclude files that are not necessary to be reviewed or do not increase the review complexity. Example: Autogenerated code, docs, project IDE setting files, binaries, etc. Check out the `Excluded` section from your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile. 
  - Understand your typical change complexity, drive towards the desired complexity by adjusting the label mapping in your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile.
  - Only use the labels that matter to you, [see context specification](./docs/prquantifier-yaml.md) to customize your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile.
- Change your engineering behaviors
  - For PRs that fall outside of the desired spectrum, review the details and check if:
    - Your PR could be split in smaller, self-contained PRs instead
    - Your PR only solves one particular issue. (For example, don't refactor and code new features in the same PR).

#### How to interpret the change counts in git diff output

- One line was added: `+1 -0`
- One line was deleted: `+0 -1`
- One line was modified: `+1 -1` (git diff doesn't know about modified, it will
interpret that line like one addition plus one deletion)
- Change percentiles: Change characteristics (addition, deletion, modification)
of this PR in relation to all other PRs within the repository.

As this PR has been closed unmerged, Renovate will ignore this upgrade and you will not receive PRs for *any* future 4.x releases. However, if you upgrade to 4.x manually then Renovate will then reenable updates for minor and patch updates automatically.

If this PR was closed by mistake or you changed your mind, you can simply rename this PR and you will soon get a fresh replacement PR opened."
34481203,IssueCommentEvent,"### ⚠ Artifact update problem

Renovate failed to update artifacts related to this branch. You probably do not want to merge this PR as-is.

♻ Renovate will retry this branch, including artifacts, only when one of the following happens:

 - any of the package files in this branch needs updating, or 
 - the branch becomes conflicted, or
 - you click the rebase/retry checkbox if found above, or
 - you rename this PR's title to start with ""rebase!"" to trigger it manually

72744584,IssueCommentEvent,"@darshankawar No crash reports found. I used the following overrides
when looking for reports

```
SymbolizationOverrides(engineHash: null, flutterVersion: null, arch: null, mode: null, force: false, format: null, os: null)
```

Note that I can only find native Android and iOS crash reports automatically,
you need to explicitly point me to crash reports in other supported formats.

If the crash report is embedded into a log and prefixed with additional
information I might not be able to automatically strip those prefixes.
Currently I only support `flutter run -v`, `adb logcat` and device lab logs.

See [my documentation](https://github.com/flutter-symbolizer-bot/flutter-symbolizer-bot/blob/main/README.md#commands) for more details on how to do that.

The Stackguard part is being improved even further with proper guard 
area sizing and more tests but that will come in a subsequent PR. This

broken code.

### Library name and version

Azure.Keyvault.Secrets 4.4.0

### Describe the bug

I recovered a deleted secret (called testSecret) using `SecretClient.StartRecoverDeletedSecretAsync()` and waited for the recovery process to finish using `WaitForCompletionAsync`. When I (immediately) try to set a new secret value using `SecretClient.SetSecretAsync()` I **sometimes** get 'Azure.RequestFailedException' with a 409 ""Secret testSecret is currently being recovered and cannot be re-created; retry later""

### Expected behavior

When StartRecoverDeletedSecretAsync() has finished succesfully, I am always able to set a new value for that secret.

### Actual behavior

Sometimes SetSecretAsync() returns a 409 with message ""Secret testSecret is currently being recovered and cannot be re-created; retry later."" with 'innererror': ""ObjectIsBeingRecovered"".

For testing purposes, I have been testing the same piece of code (delete secret, recover secret, and set secret value) in a loop. Sometimes it runs without issue, sometimes I get a 409 when setting the secret value. I've implemented a Polly retry mechanism as well to retry SetSecretAsyn() upon getting Azure.RequestFailedException, and often it succeeds after 1 or multiple retries.

### Reproduction Steps

- Secret ""testSecret"" in KeyVault in 'deleted' state and is 'recoverable' 

```
string secretName = ""testSecret""
string secretValue = ""testSecretValue""
bool Success = true;

// Recover deleted secret
RecoverDeletedSecretOperation operation = await _keyVaultSecretClient.StartRecoverDeletedSecretAsync(secretName);
await operation.WaitForCompletionAsync();
Success &= operation.HasCompleted && operation.Value.Enabled == true;
if (!isSuccess){
  return
}

// Set new secret value
KeyVaultSecret newSecretValue = new KeyVaultSecret(secretName, secretValue );
// Error occurs here
Azure.Response<KeyVaultSecret> response = await _keyVaultSecretClient.SetSecretAsync(newSecretValue);
KeyVaultSecret storedSecretValue = response?.Value;
isSuccess = storedSecretValue?.Value == newSecretValue.Value;

// Delete secret again (for next test iteration)
DeleteSecretOperation operation = await _keyVaultSecretClient.StartDeleteSecretAsync(secretName);
await operation.WaitForCompletionAsync();
```

### Environment

- .NET core 3.1
- IDE Visual Studio 17.3
- Keyvault with soft delete enabled

I recommend you give this issue a high priority, so other packages depending on you could benefit from your bug fixes and new features.

You can find below the list of errors reported by **semantic-release**. Each one of them has to be resolved in order to automatically publish your package. I’m sure you can resolve this 💪.

Errors are usually caused by a misconfiguration or an authentication problem. With each error reported below you will find explanation and guidance to help you to resolve it.

Once all the errors are resolved, **semantic-release** will release your package the next time you push a commit to the `master` branch. You can also manually restart the failed CI job that runs **semantic-release**.

If you are not sure how to resolve this, here is some links that can help you:
- [Usage documentation](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/caribou/docs/usage/README.md)
- [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/caribou/docs/support/FAQ.md)
- [Support channels](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#get-help)

If those don’t help, or if this issue is reporting something you think isn’t right, you can always ask the humans behind **[semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/issues/new)**.

### The push permission to the Git repository is required.

**semantic-release** cannot push the version tag to the branch `master` on remote Git repository with URL `http://[secure]@github.com/stencila/schema.git`.

Please refer to the [authentication configuration documentation](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/caribou/docs/usage/ci-configuration.md#authentication) to configure the Git credentials on your CI environment and make sure the [repositoryUrl](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/caribou/docs/usage/configuration.md#repositoryurl) is configured with a [valid Git URL](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-The-Protocols).

<summary>🛠 Guidelines to remediate hardcoded secrets</summary>
<br>

1. Understand the implications of revoking this secret by investigating where it is used in your code.
2. Replace and store your secrets safely. [Learn here](https://blog.gitguardian.com/secrets-api-management?utm_source=product&amp;utm_medium=GitHub_checks&amp;utm_campaign=check_run_comment) the best practices.
3. Revoke and [rotate these secrets](https://docs.gitguardian.com/secrets-detection/detectors/generics/generic_high_entropy_secret#revoke-the-secret?utm_source=product&amp;utm_medium=GitHub_checks&amp;utm_campaign=check_run_comment).
4. If possible, [rewrite git history](https://blog.gitguardian.com/rewriting-git-history-cheatsheet?utm_source=product&amp;utm_medium=GitHub_checks&amp;utm_campaign=check_run_comment). Rewriting git history is not a trivial act. You might completely break other contributing developers' workflow and you risk accidentally deleting legitimate data.

To avoid such incidents in the future consider

-   following these [best practices](https://blog.gitguardian.com/secrets-api-management/?utm_source=product&amp;utm_medium=GitHub_checks&amp;utm_campaign=check_run_comment) for managing and storing secrets including API keys and other credentials
-   install [secret detection on pre-commit](https://docs.gitguardian.com/internal-repositories-monitoring/integrations/git_hooks/pre_commit?utm_source=product&amp;utm_medium=GitHub_checks&amp;utm_campaign=check_run_comment) to catch secret before it leaves your machine and ease remediation.
