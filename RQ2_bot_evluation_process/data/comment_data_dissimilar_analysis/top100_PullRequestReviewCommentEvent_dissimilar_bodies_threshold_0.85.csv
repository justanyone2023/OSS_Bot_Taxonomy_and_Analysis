26720499,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Based on my understanding of the Windows command interpreter, I think this should work both there and in POSIX shells. It might _not_ work on PowerShell on Windows, because that adds an extra level of escaping that is often hard to deal with, but that's not a new problem nor something we can easily address in the documentation here.

With that said, the lead-in text here suggests that all of these forms are things the user might expect to see in the output of other commands, and so the escaping here is making that no longer strictly true. Perhaps we should hint that with some parenthetical text:

> * `aws_instance.baz[\""key\""]` (quotes in resource addresses must be escaped on the command line so that they are not interpreted by your shell)

        /* initialize all futures in this chunk: this would be more elegant using Lazy/Force */

```

Of course this is just a sketch but it's a bit more elegant, it (from what I can see) won't throw any exceptions anywhere, it can still be optimized with mutable cursors and good ol' `while` loops if the performance needs it.

Just a thought! Good work @dvisztempacct on pushing for concurrency idioms in the library 🙌 "
854222,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"> @dvisztempacct: each ""chunk"" must be processed serially
Oh, perhaps I misinterpreted the idea behind your `maxConcurrent`. I thought it to mean that Future's should be batched in groups of at most `maxConcurrent`.

Naturally if that wasn't the goal the implementation above can be changed by replacing the `Future.sequence` call with a `Scheduler`/`TaskRunner` that can take care of this concern.

Thanks for pointing this out! 💯 

> @dvisztempacct: This sort of design also gives the allocator a much greater workout
If by allocator you mean whoever uses this library, yes. If you mean the runtime, you'd still be creating a function for every `xs[i] |. f |. get( x => ... )` 🤔. Optimizations on both ends can be made to reuse the functions (in your case you have everything already in the upper scope, so it should be trivial to extract). It'd be interesting to compare the compiled Javascript of both solutions.

In the end your implementation will run faster than mine by the nature of it's design. I'll extract a Scheduler from it and perhaps then we can compare more fairly 👍 "

46721658,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Yeah, we can assert that--`projecteds` is empty if and only `findDefProjections` returns false.  Asserted here and for findUseProjections.

I don't think we can skip updating the LCA here: it needs to dominate `defInst->getParent()`.  The structure of chain projections is such that in order for a def projection to appear, it has to look something like this (`projection_chain_structure`):

```
parent:
  %val = ...
  cond_br ..., left, right

left:
  %d = disaggregate %val
  ...

right:
  %a = aggregate %val

...

  br merge( aggregate(...(aggregate(%a)...) )
```

In this case, so far so good: we'd update the LCA with `%d = disaggregate %val` which would make `parent` the LCA.  If the branch that's the LCA of `disaggregate` and `aggregate` is different from the block containing the def `%val`, however, the LCA is after the def block:


```
grandparent:
  %val = ...
  cond_br ..., parent, other

parent:
  cond_br ..., left, right

left:
  %d = disaggregate %val
  ...

right:
  %a = aggregate %val

...

  br merge( aggregate(...(aggregate(%a)...) )
```

In the worst case, because the LCA is wrong, the walk where liveness is determined continues past the LCA (since we just compare the current block to the LCA before pushing its predecessors) resulting in redundant `alloc_stack`s.  Without including this `defInst->getParent()` in the LCA computation, PhiStorageOptimizer incorrectly determines that there's interference in `entry` because the walk back from `destroy_value %v` continues all the way to `entry` (because LCA is incorrectly determined to be `parent` rather than `trouble2`.

46721658,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Do we need the same change in LexicalDestroyFolding's findBorroweeUsage?
46721658,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Will fix in https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/58791.
46721658,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Fixed.  It might be nice to add a convenience wrapping that to Type so that some third object didn't have to be consulted.
46721658,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"When there's only a single def (SSAPrunedLiveness), does continuing the search above that single def result in visiting instructions which can't be on the boundary?"
46721658,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Hooray--thank you!
46721658,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Is this `restrictedTo`?
46721658,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Yeah, that's fair.  Switched over to PrunedLivenessBoundary."
46721658,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Would it be worth asserting that `liveness.getBlockLiveness(block) == ::LiveWithin` at the top?
46721658,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Oops, it looks like all the tests I added didn't make it into the PR.  Fixed that (copy_propagation_onone)."
46721658,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"That's right.  An assertion would be nice, I agree.  Added."
46721658,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Done.
46721658,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"As discussed elsewhere, mayAccessPointer remains in C++."
46721658,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Just a temporary hack, I've been working on removing it."
46721658,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Something like this?

```
// Have to dig the size out of the AsyncFunctionPointer so that it can be rewritten downstream
%afp = `AsyncFunctionPointer(callee)`
%size_addr = getelementptr %afp, 0, 1
%size = load %size_addr
%context = call @swift_task_alloc(%task, %size)
// But we don't have to dig the function pointer out of the AsyncFunctionPointer because we already know what it is
call @callee(%task, %executor, %context)
```"
46721658,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Added.  That is also tested in many of the tests in IRGen/async.
46721658,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,It definitely should be.  Fixed.
46721658,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Folded a fix into https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/66728 via https://github.com/apple/swift/compare/c322ba0353dc6ddda92c9aaccd24a669b991b286..82ba69e31909925436d48b19bc40dc71f430f50c .
26586327,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Good idea, I updated the auth middleware to validate that the token can read the pr instead of the repo.

We could perform this lookup in the handler since we have to do that anyway, but it would require passing the bearer token through to the handler which probably means storing it in `context`.

I'm open to that if it's better to store the token in `context` vs having to lookup the same pull request twice. Though I do believe the github client is using caching, so perhaps that second lookup is not so bad?"
26586327,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Moved the token auth into the `simulate` handler and removed the now unneeded middleware.
26586327,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Nice catch, thanks!"
26586327,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"ah ok, so we want that check to error out if ever *asg.ASG.MinSize > 0?"
26586327,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,updated.
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"It's the same code in the same library. Why all the effort?
Isn't this making everything super complicated? :) "
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,We can also tag version 3.0?
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Changed the version in the change log to 3.0.0 :) this should keep the code nice and clean. 

Good feedback on the BC break, I didn't realize that others extend the interface to build their own implementations. "
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Ah, i just did it ;) let me know what you think."
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Fixed :) 
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Thanks! Do you have an example in the code base using the behaviour?
I do understand the reasoning but when I saw you using the `if Application.get_env....` I thought that's actually an easy solution :-) "
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Not sure about `is_auto_generated`, if there is no use-case it could be removed?"
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,The `locale` is now passed in. This could also be removed as the video already has a `language`.
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Ooops good one. Thanks! Fixed :) 
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,A docblock would be nice :) Please see the other methods.
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"There is also a [test](https://github.com/php-vcr/php-vcr/blob/master/tests/VCR/CodeTransform/CurlCodeTransformTest.php) for this class, would be great if you could update those tests as well.  "
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Docblocks would be great for this, so the type is clear."

133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Good idea, will do"
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"space between `of""204 No Content""` ;) "
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"To me `Assertion::directory($cassettePath, ""Cassette path ""'{$cassettePath}"" is not existing or not a directory"");` would be most understandable, just like the other assertions a bit further down in the constructor. Also it throws the right exception.

The same check is btw done [here](https://github.com/php-vcr/php-vcr/blob/master/src/VCR/Configuration.php#L381) with a very descriptive error message intended for end users. But it certainly doesn't hurt to do it here as well. "
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Mh great find, thanks."
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Yeah its good, makes sense."
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Ah wait I just saw the wrong usage of quotes here. I'll fix it on master

133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"You could also use the [SplObjectStorage](http://php.net/manual/en/class.splobjectstorage.php) for that, which doesn't require adding the `getIdentityHash()` function on the object."
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,No problem :) 
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Should we mention how to change the images?
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Awesome changelog!
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,What do you think of calling it 'trackThickness'? Then it is more clear what thickness it affects.
133832,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Is thickness a float or an int? I would expect an int, what happens when passing in a float?"

That work was around enabling ARM64 on Linux (in devcontainer scenarios) and we didn't dive too deep into Apple Silicon scenarios specifically. 

In the case macOS the gh CLI publishes only one architecture: AMD64 (that is, Intel, not Apple Silicon). 

Without directly verifying, my expectation is that the gh CLI relies on Rosetta 2 to handle execution or, if [installed via homebrew, builds the gh CLI from source](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/34b732b38991b8b2f26b592d87287ebc77937f19/Formula/gh.rb#L16-L18)"

2) Good idea, implemented."
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Indeed, good catch. In my mind I did it but apparently not.
See PR #54116. "
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"I,m not sure I understand the nuance... but there you have it."
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"On the contrary I think it is the original comment that is wrong. K_msleep() does trigger extra scheduler IPIs in addition to the explicit one here. Furthermore, this test does use this k_busy_wait() all over the place to give other CPUs the time to schedule and execute newly created threads, etc. So if this was a problem the entire test would be broken.
As it is, this IPI test is a bit pointless. We want to help new architecture implementors to do it right i.e. raise an IRQ on all CPUs but the current one and that is not tested anywhere. Given that the modification to the test do  work on all supported architectures already makes me wonder why you appear to be so concerned?"
702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"Hmmm... this could be confusing indeed. I wish risc-v had an official pseudo-op for that.

702790,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,The MP configuration is not the same as the SMP configuration. In the former there is no notion of multiple CPUs from Zephyr's perspective. Look at the `_current_cpu` definition for example. And obviously the kernel/mp test ddoes pass with this.

83997633,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"I've added dependabot to automatically bump ""msi"" crate in the ""msi_ffi"" crate, so it automatically opens a PR in case you forget to update ""msi_ffi"" crate. However, you'll still need to publish the crate manually. That's some work, but considering the library is nearly finished, and there isn't active/frequent development (except bug fixes, etc...), I think it's okay."

83997633,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Can't we prioritize windows installers to get published along with the release?
83997633,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"@zdtsw We can change the workflow to run on a `workflow_dispatch` event. The `workflow_dispatch` workflows are workflows which are triggered manually.

The internal CI which publishes GitHub releases can trigger the WinGet workflow programmatically after all 4 binaries have been published (JDK/JRE x64/x86) and pass the GitHub release tag with it (see https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/workflows#create-a-workflow-dispatch-event to how to do it).

What happened here?"
4725494,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,Is there any reason you're not using `(bool)` here?
4725494,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,There is a special case for `ShippingMethodPriceDefinition`. We've deprecated a float price + currency id and replaced it with a price field. You have to update `price` manually if `shopware.deployment.blue_green === false`  (that means db trigger in that context).

4725494,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"This actually adds some performance issues. Adding more and more joins to an already (quite) huge and critical SQL statement might lead to an exponential loss of performance in bigger systems.

# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[INSERT CONTACT METHOD].
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the community.

37936606,PullRequestReviewCommentEvent,"### Explaining `this.setState`

How do we change data within a state variable?

Unfortunately, we can't just do `this.state.studentsList = .....` to change data.

To set the state of a state variable we have to use the method, `this.setState`.

Take a look at the method on line 30 in `src/App.jsx`

When this method is called, it is adding `assignmentName` to our state variable `assignments` by setting the state of `assignments` to itself with the concatenation of `assignmentName`.

We are going to set some state in next steps.

You are using the `get` method without a default argument to return the value of a key in a dictionary. We recommended that you use a default argument so that if the value for your key is not found, a default value is returned. If a default value is not provided and the key is not found, then `None` is returned.

**Problem:**
 This line of code lacks validation when processing input data through the following parameter: &#39;check_time&#39; (index: 1 | type: Unknown). The parameter is exposed to external callers, because its enclosing class and method are publicly accessible. This means that upstream validation, if it exists, can be bypassed. Other validated parameters: &#39;timeout&#39;. The same parameter type is validated here for example: amazon-sagemaker-examples/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms/forecasting_services_comparison/util/fcst_utils.py:76. Malicious, malformed, or unbounded inputs can cause unexpected runtime behavior or crashes, and can slow performance.

**Fix:**
 Add checks to ensure the validity of the parameter&#39;s value, such as testing it for nullness, emptiness, or equality. Or to prevent direct calls to it, [reduce the method&#39;s visibility](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#descriptive-naming-styles) using single or double underscore.
