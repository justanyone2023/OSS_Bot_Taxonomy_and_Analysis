Per https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/12112#issuecomment-292619346 :

> As others have identified, the upgrade process creates a patch file, then tries to apply the patch. When it tries to apply a --3way patch, it will fail if it encounters any errors such as those above ☝️. Unfortunately, it reverses the whole patch when a 3-way patch fails to apply.
> 
> If you change the git strategy for applying the patch from --3way to --reject, it will allow your changes to go through, then you just have to resolve and remove the .rej files where it had errored out. You can either do this after it fails using the patch file @ajwhite found, or change the cliEntry.js directly as described in the PR description.

## Motivation

This has been an open issue since 2017-01-29 with a well-defined solution (see issue).

13025337,PullRequestEvent,"When namespaces is empty or null it means ""this pod's namespace""
In Kubernetes [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#an-example-of-a-pod-that-uses-pod-affinity):

```
In addition to labelSelector and topologyKey, you can optionally specify a list of namespaces which the labelSelector should match against using the namespaces field at the same level as labelSelector and topologyKey. If omitted or empty, namespaces defaults to the namespace of the Pod where the affinity/anti-affinity definition appears.
```

Settings `namespaces` to the release namespace is equivalent to not setting it at all. Although it's harmless, if you want to do any post-rendering involving the namespaces it's difficult if `namespaces` is specified.

26634292,PullRequestEvent,"- closes #279 
- I couldn't find this string-wrapping functionality in an existing Julia package, so hopefully it's okay to have this code here. The added `src/` code excluding docstrings is fairly short, but overall this did require a bit more code than i'd hoped.
  - the closest packages i could find were MultilintStrings.jl which bascially does the opposite operation, and JuliaFormatter.jl which addressed a similar but much more advanced problem and works on the Concrete Syntax Tree not strings.
- i regenerated the services pages, so that the effect of these changes are easy to review, but before merging i can revert those changes and leave it to the GHA job to update these files automatically if we prefer.
  - code changes are in `src/AWSMetadataUtilities.jl`, `test/AWSMetadataUtilities.jl`

This is a quick fix, but wanted to get thoughts on whether this is applicable for all `HTTP.StatusError`s? Another option would be to `try` `catch` the xml parsing, or actually check that the response information is a valid xml.

This is an attempt to refactor our queue families so that we can create command pools from them as opposed to the queues. It refactors the way we discover adapters and queue families.

The PR introduces a concept of a `QueueGroup`, which is spawned from a particular queue family. There is `RawQueueGroup` and a stronger-typed `QueueGroup` that is capability-aware. Command pools can be made out of queue groups.

8566911,PullRequestEvent,"Add ""-O2"" to all compiler/linker tests. This makes compiler/linker
feature probing better resemble actual compiling later.

Why?
----

zig c++ is a clang front-end[1] that accepts, among other things, the
target over the command line. This command:

    zig c++ -target x86_64-linux-gnu main.o -o main

Will:
1. Pre-compile libc++.a.
2. Link the program with libc++.a from (1).

Currently Go only is learning about one flag from the linker, that is,
""--no-gc-sections"". The resulting command that tests for the flag
support is this:

    c++ -Wl,--no-gc-sections -x c - -o

This causes Zig to pre-compile libc++.a in debug mode. Then the actual
compiler+linker command from CGo adds a few more flags, including ""-O2"":

    c++ <...> -Wl,--no-gc-sections -O2 <...>

From Zig perspective, debug-mode libc++.a is different from the
optimized one; that causes Zig to compile a new libc++.a. Specifically,
Zig adds ""-fno-omit-frame-pointer"" for debug builds, and
""-fomit-frame-pointer"" for optimized builds.

As a result, we have to two sets of libc++.a for every arch/os tuple.
That takes CPU time and a bit of disk space.

Zig performance impact
----------------------

First compilation of a simple CGo application is faster by ~2.5 seconds
or ~60%:

    $ CC=""zig c++ -target x86_64-linux-gnu.2.28"" hyperfine \
        --warmup 3 --runs 10 \
        --prepare 'rm -fr ~/.cache/zig ~/.cache/go-build /tmp/go-*' \
        --parameter-list go go1.19,go1.19-O2 \
        '/code/go/bin/{go} build .'
    Benchmark 1: /code/go/bin/go1.19 build .
      Time (mean ± σ):      6.168 s ±  0.059 s    [User: 7.465 s, System: 1.578 s]
      Range (min … max):    6.111 s …  6.242 s    10 runs

    Benchmark 2: /code/go/bin/go1.19-O2 build .
      Time (mean ± σ):      3.816 s ±  0.080 s    [User: 4.730 s, System: 1.130 s]
      Range (min … max):    3.657 s …  3.958 s    10 runs

    Summary
      '/code/go/bin/go1.19-O2 build .' ran
        1.62 ± 0.04 times faster than '/code/go/bin/go1.19 build .'

If we add C++ to the mix, the difference grows to almost ~23 seconds, or
almost 90%:

    $ CC=""zig c++ -target x86_64-linux-gnu.2.28"" hyperfine \
        --warmup 1 --runs 3 \
        --prepare 'rm -fr ~/.cache/zig ~/.cache/go-build /tmp/go-*' \
        --parameter-list go go1.19,go1.19-O2 \
        '/code/go/bin/{go} build .'

    Benchmark 1: CC=""zig c++ -target x86_64-linux-gnu.2.28"" /code/go/bin/go1.19 build .
      Time (mean ± σ):     51.137 s ±  0.183 s    [User: 234.165 s, System: 15.005 s]
      Range (min … max):   50.934 s … 51.288 s    3 runs

    Benchmark 2: CC=""zig c++ -target x86_64-linux-gnu.2.28"" /code/go/bin/go1.19-O2 build .
      Time (mean ± σ):     27.102 s ±  0.068 s    [User: 119.816 s, System: 8.513 s]
      Range (min … max):   27.038 s … 27.174 s    3 runs

    Summary
      '/code/go/bin/go1.19-O2 build .' ran
        1.89 ± 0.01 times faster than '/code/go/bin/go1.19 build .'

The difference is just due to the fact that Zig will not be instructed
to compile libc++.a for debug builds; Go doesn't need that.

Non-Zig performance impact
--------------------------

A.k.a. does ""-O2"" for this check worsen performance?

No statistically significant performance differences with both clang-15
and gcc-11. Also, it affects only the first compile of a CGo progam, as
the linker tests are cached across invocations. go1.19 binary is the
go1.19 tag; go1.19-O2 is go1.19 + this patch.

Alternatives considered
-----------------------

There are a few alternatives:

1. Add ""-O2"" for linker-only tests. That looks like too much catering to
   zig alone. If we can add it, then add for everything.
2. Add ""-fomit-frame-pointer"" instead of ""-O2"". This flag does not
   universally imply debug mode, thus same argument applies as to (1).
3. Add ""-O2"" for this particular test (`--no-gc-sections`). This is
   brittle and not future-proof: a future linker test may omit this
   flag.

Sometimes you may see multiple options for the same dependency (e.g. pinning in one branch and upgrading in another). This is expected and allows you the flexibility to choose which to merge first. Once you merge any PR, others will be updated or removed the next time Renovate runs.

Would you like to change the way Renovate is upgrading your dependencies? Simply edit the `renovate.json` in this branch and this Pull Request description will be updated the next time Renovate runs.

Our [Configuration Docs](https://renovateapp.com/docs/) should be helpful if you wish to modify any behaviour.

#### Don't want a `renovate.json` file?

51497074,PullRequestEvent,"This creates a custom-agent deploy strategy that allows cloud_defend to run in the system test environment by running with a root agent and leaving an empty volume at `/cloud-defend-heartbeat` so cloud_defend doesn't try to deploy it's ebpf or kubernetes sensors.

## Add: cloud_defend System test

This adds a system test for the heartbeat data stream in the cloud_defend package.
It includes a custom agent deploy method that triggers an inert state in cloud_defend
where none of the sensors are deployed, since the full functionality of cloud_defend 
is not supported in the kind k8s testing environment at the time of writing.

This PR adds a new OTEL datastream to the existing NGINX package. The datastream has OTEL Schema. 
It also generates fields as per ECS schema using 2 different ways: 

1. Field aliasing: The fields which require a simple renaming are aliased in fields.yml
2. Add to the processor in OTEL collector config. 

**The user can search and query for both OTEL fields and ECS fields in the same dataset.**

### Thoughts
1. The OTEL Fields having labels, can't be aliased since there is no conditional aliasing supported. Hence they are added to processors. 

   -  We can evaluate the option of having these fields as runtime fields

2. Aliased fields are not part of the _source. The fields coming in through processors are seen in the _source
3. For existing customers, there would be need to create opposite alias in the existing indices, so that in existing data also the OTEL fields can be searched. Eg: 
         - name: nginx.requests
           type: alias
           path: nginx.stubstatus.requests
           description: Aliasing the ES field to  OTEL field

<h2>Changelog</h2>
<h3>RTK Query Selector Usage Fixes</h3>
<p>The previous <a href=""https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.2""><code>v2.0.0-rc.2</code> release</a> picked up Reselect's dev mode checks for result functions that just return their input, like <code>x =&gt; x</code>.  Turns out that some of RTK Query's internal selector usage did that in some cases :)  That resulted in a ton of warnings being printed.  We've updated our internals to fix that.</p>
<h3>Reselect Changes</h3>
<p>The Reselect <code>defaultMemoize</code> function has now been renamed to <code>lruMemoize</code>, since it's no longer the default. See the <a href=""https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reduxjs/reselect/releases/tag/v5.0.0-rc.1"">Reselect <code>v5.0.0-rc.1</code> release notes</a> for more details.</p>

<h3>Reselect Changes</h3>
<p><a href=""https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reduxjs/reselect/releases/tag/v5.0.0-rc.0"">Reselect v5.0.0-rc.0</a> makes the breaking change to use <code>weakMapMemoize</code> as the default memoization implementation for <code>createSelector</code>.  This memoizer has an effectively infinite cache size, which should cut down on the number of recalculations in a typical app, and help improve performance overall.  <strong>This <em>is</em> a breaking change</strong>, but one that should be invisible to most users.</p>
<p>It also adds a new dev-mode check for result functions that look like <code>x =&gt; x</code>, which is almost always a mistake.</p>
<p>See <a href=""https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reduxjs/reselect/releases/tag/v5.0.0-rc.0"">the Reselect v5.0.0-rc.0 release notes</a> for more details.</p>

<h2>Changelog</h2>
<h3><code>isAction</code> Predicate</h3>
<p>We recently added an <code>isAction</code> predicate to RTK, then realized it's better suited for the Redux core.  This can be used anywhere you have a value that <em>could</em> be a Redux action object, and you need to check if it is actually an action.  This is specifically useful for use with the updated Redux middleware TS types, where the default value is now <code>unknown</code> and you need to use a type guard to tell TS that the current value is actually an action.</p>
<p>This is now exported from the Redux core, and re-exported from RTK, which also uses it internally to avoid duplicating that logic.</p>
<p>We've also exported the <code>isPlainObject</code> util that's been in the Redux codebase for years as well.</p>
<h3>ESM Build Artifacts</h3>
<p>We previously dropped the UMD build artifacts in an earlier alpha, but added ESM build artifacts that are pre-compiled to remove the <code>process.env.NODE_ENV</code> definitions, with the intent that these are useable as <code>&lt;script type=""module""&gt;</code> tags in the browser.  Those were previously named as <code>redux-toolkit.modern.development.mjs</code> and <code>redux-toolkit.modern.production.mjs</code>.</p>
<p>We've renamed the production artifact to <code>redux-toolkit.browser.mjs</code> to be consistent with the other Redux-related packages, and removed the dev build artifact on the grounds that we don't think there's enough likely usage to include it.  If you think you would specifically benefit from having an ESM browser-compatible dev artifact, let us know!</p>

### Preamble by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir)

> ***Mir*** ([Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language): Мир, IPA: [[ˈmʲir\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Russian); lit. 'peace' or 'world') was a [space station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station) that operated in [low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit) from 1986 to 2001, operated by the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union) and later by [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia). *Mir* was the first modular space station and was assembled in orbit from 1986 to 1996. It had a greater mass than any previous [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft). At the time it was the largest [artificial satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_satellite) in orbit, succeeded by the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) (ISS) after *Mir*'s [orbit decayed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_decay).

I take no part, nor am I interested in maintaining the [CKAN][ckan:url] mod metadata for my mods.

[CKAN][ckan:url] is a great mod for those that can't use zip tools.

If you are having issues please let the [CKAN][ckan:url] people know and refer to the [CKAN][ckan:url] thread.

My support of [CKAN][ckan:url] extends as far as me checking the checkbox in Spacedock when I upload.

Beware, [CKAN][ckan:url] *can* really mess up though it tries very, very, very hard not to.

## Description

![QuackPack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamespglaze/QuackPack/main/Banner/QuackPack.png)
# QuackPack
QuackPack is intended to fill out an often neglected portion of the Kerbolar system: the deep inner system, far below the orbit of Moho.  Oftentimes, when a player has conquered the stock system, it may feel like the only way to access more challenging destinations is to install full system replacers, or interstellar mods.

System expansions such as Outer Planets Mod are a very popular first step, bridging the challenge gap between the stock system and full blown interstellar packs. QuackPack is designed to add an additional level of challenge to a stock + OPM install.  Instead of looking outwards towards other stars, it is time to look inwards towards our own.

These planets are not for the faint of heart.  Transfer requirements are extreme, and their gravity wells are deep.  Gravity assists are a near requirement. Failure lurks around every corner, as the unique thermal environments can cause unexpected problems, or outright destroy craft.  Aerodynamics will work in unusual ways, as the superheated atmospheres are very different from anything else in the Kerbolar system.  However, with smart design, clever planning, and skill, these bodies can be conquered, even fully reusable, or, theoretically, with single stage craft.

## Bodies
* Blas, a metal poor, scorching hot desert Superkerbin with a large ring system and one small moonlet.
* Geet, the lone moon of Blas, and a shepherd to the ring system.
* Jot, an inflated hot Jool with an extremely large atmosphere.
* Cind, a Kerbin sized tidally locked hellworld, with an atmosphere made of sulfur and boiling metal.

## Features
* 4 challenging new bodies to explore.
* Science and career mode ready, with full biome and experiment definitions.
* Full scatterer integration.
* Full EVE integration, with clouds, sandstorms, lightning, aurorae, and thermal glow.
* Planetshine and Distant Object Enhancement integration.

KSRe rebalances several core game mechanics to add greater realism and new challenges.

### mechanics rebalanced:

* **attitude control**
* **propulsion**
* **strategies**
* **science**
* **tech tree** via [CARP](https://github.com/maj-mal-funqt10n/CARP) *(separated due to scope)*

### also recommended

* PersistentRotation

## full list of changes

### attitude control

* reaction wheel torque nerfed to realistic levels (1% of stock)
* several probe cores have increased SAS level and internal mono tanks
* added gimbal to more SRBs

### propulsion

* most engine costs increased based on aerospace company estimates (65-90% of total launch vehicle cost)
* most engines have reduced throttle range (many don't throttle; others based on J-2 & RS-25 engines)
* solid fuel engines have simple thrust curve based on circular grain shape

![thrustcurve](https://i.imgur.com/TAW7CBk.png)

### science

* increased repeatability of most experiments
* sensors now transmit for full value
* materials experiments require lab to reset and transmit less
* lab nerfed
* experiments added to stock resource scanners
* some experiments cost reduced

### strategies

* many strategies rebalanced with reduced setup costs and increased rewards

### contracts

* added resource scanners to stock science contracts
* added some engines to stock part test contracts
* removed expensive engines from stock part test contracts

854222,PullRequestEvent,"Hello folks! 👋🏽  

Hope this PR finds you well, I'm just here to ask a few questions since the code is not yet in a state where I'd ask for a proper review, but I still wanted to have some code to frame a portion of the discussion around a specific implementation approach.

By the end of last year, I started rewriting the Caramel compiler to target the Core Erlang language. This is essentially the Erlang VM's equivalent to OCaml Lambda.

In my effort to do this, I realized that it would be terribly simpler to just translate from OCaml Lambda rather than the Typedtree, but also that the Lambda language was missing several pieces of information that would be needed for me to build something that made any sense for the Erlang VM. 

For example, variant constructors being replaced with integers doesn't help a lot in creating idiomatic Core Erlang, but passing around constructor metadata allows me to turn those constructors into atoms instead. You could argue that the Erlang VM will turn those atoms into integers _anyways_, but the quality of life improvement of a pattern-match error on an `'None'` is considerably better than just seeing a `0`.

In any case, I made some changes throughout the compiler to thread in and ignore metadata on a few of the use-cases I needed and would like to request some comments from you on a few things.

1. Is this something that I could work on to upstream that would be welcomed into the compiler? -- there are several languages being built by forking off OCaml, that are struggling to keep up with the progress happening here, whereas that talent could be better spent in the upstream compiler. 4 examples right now are Reason, ReScript, Caramel, and Grain (although this one is primarily interested in the type-checker).

2. What would be an approach for adding metadata that would have the least impact on backends that do not need it? -- I opted for a naive extension of the lambda constructors with optional values, but perhaps this would lead to a lot of duplication when we are using the metadata. Perhaps it is okay to have a configurable flag to bypass adding the metadata everywhere, so it'll just be carrying around an additional None value.

3. Would it be interesting to extend the bytecode compiler to make use of this metadata somehow? -- For example, I can imagine Js_of_ocaml being able to use some of this data to provide more expressive errors.

4. Would it make sense to start with a small subset of the metadata and grow this on a need-basis or would you rather spend some time collecting all the metadata available first? -- the proposed subset is enough for my current needs for Caramel, but I can imagine extending it to support use-cases in Reason and ReScript, potentially helping those drop their forks entirely.

In any case, thanks for making an awesome language <3 and let me know what you think!

🙌🏽

### Overview

This is a first pass at generating an enum in the generated OCaml.

### Features

- Adds an example of an enum into the C example code that was crashing when running `dune build`
- In IR we now store the name of the enum variant from C as well as an integer constant (right now I just used `List.mapi` so it assumes starting from zero going up)
- In caml generation we use `Ptype_variant` to generate the OCaml representation of the enum

### Fixes

- I added an `<stdio.h>` include as the C compiler was reporting a warning and I believe this is why the Github Action CI is failing

### Future Improvements

Admittedly I haven't used stub generation of ctypes but I know that even in dynamic linking mode it supports marshalling between ocaml adt <-> c enum using a ""view"" (reference: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ctypes-enum-how-to-make-it-work/456/4)
so next steps would be

1. generate `of_int` and `to_int` functions
2. handle numbers assigned to C enums (e.g. `MY_ENUM = 0x05`) -

32282838,PullRequestEvent,"### Pull Request Motivation

Vault distributions like ""Bank Vaults"" automatically configure
and provision Vault and provide the CA bundle via a Kubernetes
Secret. Having to hard-code the bundle in the Issuer instead
of dynamically referencing it through the Secret requires
a manual second step when using a GitOps workflow.

### Kind

/kind feature

### Release Note

```release-note
Feature: adds caBundleSecretRef to the Vault Issuer to allow referencing the Vault CA Bundle with a Secret. Cannot be used in conjunction with the in-line caBundle field.

32282838,PullRequestEvent,"This addresses two problems:
 * The finalizer was being removed unconditionally, regardless of whether solver.Cleanup succeeds
 * The finalizer was assumed to be the first in the list of finalizers, potentially resulting in the removal of foreign finalizers and resulting in the cleanup finalizer never being removed.
 * solver.Cleanup was invoked inconsistently from two different places, in handleFinalizer and in an `acme.IsFinalState` block, but in the former, the Status.Processing and Status.Presented fields were not being reset and in the latter case, the finalizer wasn't being removed if the cleanup succeeded.

          ""Description"": ""Helm is a package manager for Charts for Kubernetes. Versions prior to 3.14.2 contain an uninitialized variable vulnerability when Helm parses index and plugin yaml files missing expected content. When either an `index.yaml` file or a plugins `plugin.yaml` file were missing all metadata a panic would occur in Helm. In the Helm SDK, this is found when using the `LoadIndexFile` or `DownloadIndexFile` functions in the `repo` package or the `LoadDir` function in the `plugin` package. For the Helm client this impacts functions around adding a repository and all Helm functions if a malicious plugin is added as Helm inspects all known plugins on each invocation. This issue has been resolved in Helm v3.14.2. If a malicious plugin has been added which is causing all Helm client commands to panic, the malicious plugin can be manually removed from the filesystem. If using Helm SDK versions prior to 3.14.2, calls to affected functions can use `recover` to catch the panic."",

```release-note
Fix: The alpha feature Certificate's `additionalOutputFormats` is now correctly validated at admission time, and no longer _only_ validated if the `privateKey` field of the Certificate is set. The Webhook component now contains a seperate feature set. 
`AdditionalCertificateOutputFormats` feature gate (disabled by default) has been added to the webhook. This gate is required to be enabled on both the controller and webhook components in order to make use of the Certificate's `additionalOutputFormat` feature.

Since nm-fortisslvpn-pppd-plugin.so has been brought back, (supposedly) there have been some missing dependencies. When I had tried to use the plugin built from master, it complained about a missing symbol (and openfortivpn dumped core):

```
Jul 25 16:56:34 myhostname pppd[13496]: /usr/lib/pppd/2.4.7/nm-fortisslvpn-pppd-plugin.so: undefined symbol: _nm_utils_ascii_str_to_int64
Jul 25 16:56:34 myhostname pppd[13496]: Couldn't load plugin /usr/lib/pppd/2.4.7/nm-fortisslvpn-pppd-plugin.so

Jul 26 00:41:11 myhostname pppd[17061]: Couldn't load plugin /usr/lib/pppd/2.4.7/nm-fortisslvpn-pppd-plugin.so
```

I did my best to understand why, and the patch attached to this report summarizes my findings: it didn't know where to find implementation of _nm_utils_ascii_str_to_int64 and nm_utils_ip4_netmask_to_prefix because of a missing links to shared utils source and libnm."

<h2>1.13.9 / 2022-10-18</h2>
<h3>Security</h3>
<ul>
<li>[CRuby] Vendored libxml2 is updated to address <a href=""https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2309"">CVE-2022-2309</a>, <a href=""https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40304"">CVE-2022-40304</a>, and <a href=""https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40303"">CVE-2022-40303</a>. See <a href=""https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/security/advisories/GHSA-2qc6-mcvw-92cw"">GHSA-2qc6-mcvw-92cw</a> for more information.</li>
<li>[CRuby] Vendored zlib is updated to address <a href=""https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2022-37434"">CVE-2022-37434</a>. Nokogiri was not affected by this vulnerability, but this version of zlib was being flagged up by some vulnerability scanners, see <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2626"">#2626</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<ul>
<li>[CRuby] Vendored libxml2 is updated to <a href=""https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/releases/v2.10.3"">v2.10.3</a> from v2.9.14.</li>
<li>[CRuby] Vendored libxslt is updated to <a href=""https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxslt/-/releases/v1.1.37"">v1.1.37</a> from v1.1.35.</li>
<li>[CRuby] Vendored zlib is updated from 1.2.12 to 1.2.13. (See <a href=""https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/blob/v1.13.x/LICENSE-DEPENDENCIES.md#platform-releases"">LICENSE-DEPENDENCIES.md</a> for details on which packages redistribute this library.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>[CRuby] <code>Nokogiri::XML::Namespace</code> objects, when compacted, update their internal struct's reference to the Ruby object wrapper. Previously, with GC compaction enabled, a segmentation fault was possible after compaction was triggered. [<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2658"">#2658</a>] (Thanks, <a href=""https://github.com/eightbitraptor""><code>@​eightbitraptor</code></a> and <a href=""https://github.com/peterzhu2118""><code>@​peterzhu2118</code></a>!)</li>
<li>[CRuby] <code>Document#remove_namespaces!</code> now defers freeing the underlying <code>xmlNs</code> struct until the <code>Document</code> is GCed. Previously, maintaining a reference to a <code>Namespace</code> object that was removed in this way could lead to a segfault. [<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2658"">#2658</a>]</li>

<h3>Deprecated</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>XML::Reader#attribute_nodes</code> is deprecated due to incompatibility between libxml2's <code>xmlReader</code> memory semantics and Ruby's garbage collector. Although this method continues to exist for backwards compatibility, it is unsafe to call and may segfault.

<h2>1.13.9 / 2022-10-18</h2>
<h3>Security</h3>
<ul>
<li>[CRuby] Vendored libxml2 is updated to address <a href=""https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2309"">CVE-2022-2309</a>, <a href=""https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40304"">CVE-2022-40304</a>, and <a href=""https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40303"">CVE-2022-40303</a>. See <a href=""https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/security/advisories/GHSA-2qc6-mcvw-92cw"">GHSA-2qc6-mcvw-92cw</a> for more information.</li>
<li>[CRuby] Vendored zlib is updated to address <a href=""https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2022-37434"">CVE-2022-37434</a>. Nokogiri was not affected by this vulnerability, but this version of zlib was being flagged up by some vulnerability scanners, see <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2626"">#2626</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<ul>
<li>[CRuby] Vendored libxml2 is updated to <a href=""https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/releases/v2.10.3"">v2.10.3</a> from v2.9.14.</li>
<li>[CRuby] Vendored libxslt is updated to <a href=""https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxslt/-/releases/v1.1.37"">v1.1.37</a> from v1.1.35.</li>
<li>[CRuby] Vendored zlib is updated from 1.2.12 to 1.2.13. (See <a href=""https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/blob/v1.13.x/LICENSE-DEPENDENCIES.md#platform-releases"">LICENSE-DEPENDENCIES.md</a> for details on which packages redistribute this library.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>[CRuby] <code>Nokogiri::XML::Namespace</code> objects, when compacted, update their internal struct's reference to the Ruby object wrapper. Previously, with GC compaction enabled, a segmentation fault was possible after compaction was triggered. [<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2658"">#2658</a>] (Thanks, <a href=""https://github.com/eightbitraptor""><code>@​eightbitraptor</code></a> and <a href=""https://github.com/peterzhu2118""><code>@​peterzhu2118</code></a>!)</li>
<li>[CRuby] <code>Document#remove_namespaces!</code> now defers freeing the underlying <code>xmlNs</code> struct until the <code>Document</code> is GCed. Previously, maintaining a reference to a <code>Namespace</code> object that was removed in this way could lead to a segfault. [<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2658"">#2658</a>]</li>

This is far from perfect, as the new output still shows the expected/actual values three times for some reason in IntelliJ (only twice in TeamCity), but I think it's still a significant improvement in how readable the output is."

It will be my first addition to the HCL2 language, so bear with me. I've created this PR with readability in mind. A thing that struck me was that a chain of assignments where one of the assignments is a multi-line value isn't aligned.

This PR aligns that case.

So the following snippet;
```
a = 1 # foo
bungle = (
    ""bonce""
) # baz
zebra = ""striped"" # baz
```
will be formatted as follows;
```
a      = 1         # foo
bungle = (
  ""bonce""
)                  # baz
zebra  = ""striped"" # baz
```

Looks better, right? That said, it obviously is up for debate.

32125183,PullRequestEvent,"## Description of the Change

This PR is created to finally make our CI satisfy proposed requirements by our developers team.
### 1 Major changes
#### 1.1 Pipeline stages
Since now, the Pipeline consists of 6 stages. You can see the ascii-art pipeline version in the `Jenkinsfile`

| Stage | Description |
|:--:|:---|
| Pre-build | Cancels previous build job (except if current branch is `develop`) |
| Build | Build step for all platforms (currently `ARMv7`, `ARMv8`, `x86_64`, `MacOS` are present) |
| Pre-coverage | Launch coverage target before running tests |
| Tests | Run required tests for specified platforms |
| Post-Coverage | Run coverage after tests step |
| Build rest | Build (if required): 1) documentation 2) bindings 3) release version of `iroha` |

This division is made to improve visibility of the CI build process.
Stage separation is implemented in Jenkinsfile. All stage methods are implemented in `.jenkinsci/debug-build.groovy`, `.jenkinsci/release-build.groovy`, `.jenkinsci/mac-debug-build.groovy`, `.jenkinsci/mac-release-build.groovy` (note that `MacOS` build goes on the physical machine, not in the docker container, that's why there's another file for `MacOS` platform)

#### 1.2 On-demand Jenkins agents

Since now `x86_64` agents are moved to AWS EC2. There are 4 different labels added to the pipeline (note that it could be easily modified in Jenkins configuration):
- `x86_64_aws_build` -- general purpose instance with 8 CPU, 32 Gb RAM (x86_64 builds in 8 threads)
- `x86_64_aws_test` -- general purpose instance with 1 CPU, 2 Gb RAM for running tests
- `x86_64_aws_cov` -- general purpose instance with 1 CPU, 2 Gb RAM for running coverage
- `x86_64_aws_sonar` -- general purpose instance with 1 CPU, 2 Gb RAM for running `sonarscanner`

Now, the amount of `x86_64` agents will be float, as their amount is managed by Jenkins.

> *Note:* With migration to Amazon AWS EC2 on-demand agents the logic of some methods has been changed. The text below describes this change.

**On-demand agent start-up process**
Before freshly created and launched new AWS instance becomes the Jenkins agent, init script is executed. It mounts 4 folders via NFS share (AWS EFS - Amazon Elastic Filesystem).
- Jenkins workspace (`/var/jenkins`)
- `cmake` build cache (`/opt/.ccache`)
- `cmake` release build cache (`/opt/.ccache-release`)
- docker images storage (`/tmp/docker`)

**On-demand agent pipeline lifecycle**
In case the build occures on the `x86_64*` agent, the created docker image (stage `Build`) is saved to AWS EFS (Amazon Elastic Filesystem) using `docker save -o` command with file name `/tmp/docker/<branch_name_sha1>`. (see file `.jenkinsci/docker-pull-or-build.groovy`, method `dockerPullOrUpdate()`). When going to the next stage, new `x86_64*` agent is created, docker image is loaded from the file `/tmp/docker/<branch_name_sha1>` using `docker load` command.

After the stage finishes, the docker container is stopped and removed, results are saved to the Jenkins workspace (and to the AWS EFS respectively), thus, none of the data is lost.

#### 1.3 Merge availability

To make CI available to perform automatic merge process the list of features should be implemented: 
- check merge requirements compliance
- merge strategy

Merge requirements set in `hyperledger/iroha` repository:
- at least 2 `APPROVED` reviews
- CI checks are passed (`armv7`, `armv8` are turned off in case of `MergePR` is chosen)
- all commits are `sign-off`

Merge strategy regarding the branches:
- `trunk` + `develop` -- `squash & merge`
- `master` -- merge

All checks are made using Github API. To see the implementation, go to `.jenkinsci/github-api.groovy` file.

> To merge, developer should go to ```Jenkins -> iroha -> iroha-hyperledger -> Pull Requests -> PR # -> Build with Parameters``` and set checkpoint for Merge_PR.

#### 1.4 CI notifications

Build result notifications were added. Table below describes the notification scenario:

|Scenario|Behavior|
|:--:|:--|
| Branch commit|sends e-mail to git commit author|
| Open or Commit Pull Request | posts comment with PR reviewers mention on the PR page |
| Merge to `trunk` | sends e-mail to git commit author |
| Merge to `develop` | sends e-mail to git commit author + Andrei + Fyodor |
| Merge to `master` | sends e-mail to iroha-maintainers team |

Notification e-mail contains compressed log in attachmens + build status.
see `.jenkinsci/notifications.groovy`,`Jenkinsfile` (cleanup post-step at the end of the file)

#### 1.5 Tests launch separation

This feature is implemented as a method that returns regex string (file `.jenkinsci/test-launcher.groovy`)
This method is called in the `Jenkinsfile` stage `Tests` and its return string is passed as a parameter to the `doTestStep()` method. More detailed description of test types execution according to the build strategy is provided in the next section (1.6)

#### 1.6 Default order of execution

Table contains requirements for order of pipeline execution. 

|Scenario|Build Behavior|Coverage|Tests|Packages|Docs|Bindings|
|:--:|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Branch commit|x86_64 gcc-5.4 build|by request|`module` tests|by request|by request|by request|

### 2 Minor changes

- Fixed absence of `--output-on-failure` flag on `MacOS` tests.
- Modified post-step for whole CI allowed to fix execution logic
- Fixed clean-up procedures:
  - separated `linuxPostStep()` method from `jenkinsci/linux-post-step.groovy` into `postStep()` and `cleanUp()` methods. `postStep()` method is authoritative for uploading artifacts after release build, when `cleanUp()` removes folders created during builds
  - fixed the call cases for the `doDockerCleanup()`. Now this method been called only from the pipeline's cleanup post-step, at `armv7`, `armv8` agents.
  - fixed the stale docker images cleanup ([IR-1293](https://soramitsu.atlassian.net/browse/IR-1293), [IR-1451](https://soramitsu.atlassian.net/browse/IR-1451))
## Benefits
- reduced build time (~15-20 mins for branch commit, except branch commit with changes dockerfile, it takes additional 30-50 minutes)
- automatic merge by CI
- defined workflow that covers all scenario

This PR will avoid warning ""Unhandled rejected promise warning"" when using async/await and a promise gets rejected.

I think this change is correct after reading https://metacpan.org/pod/Future::AsyncAwait::Awaitable#AWAIT_DONE where it says ""...result of an existing still-pending future"", which means there's no reason to create new promise objects.

### Motivation
Less warnings."

This should be a general way to get a correct 'flavor' string for openQA results, and because we check for ""fedora.updates-"" in the scenario string, it shouldn't do anything weird for results from CI that don't follow the same conventions.

populated with the current logstash version.

This message will only be emitted if the runner gets far enough to actually
start up (e.g., if it is not passed a flag that causes it to bail early)

9386276,PullRequestEvent,Data directory info is missing in setting-up-logstash.asciidoc as reported in #8423. This fixes that.
9386276,PullRequestEvent,"We talked about this in one of our Java exec meetings.
On the road to getting some adoption of `FieldReference` the concept of `PathCache` is kind of confusing.

Also, removing `PathCache` and integrating this all into `FieldReference` makes sure we don't expose `FieldReference.parse()` anymore which we shouldn't, given that `FieldReferences` are globally deduped."
9386276,PullRequestEvent,Leftover from #8186: this lock is useless since the write operation (and all other Queue operations for that matter) is locked on the Java side.
9386276,PullRequestEvent,"Will have to document this better so WIP for now, functionally this step should be fine though.

### Changes

* Compile `Dataset`s for outputs in a more efficient optimal fashion
  * Cache `Callsite` for `multi_receive` instead of implementing Java interface from Ruby (this has quite a bit of overhead)
   * Don't loop over `Dataset`, unroll parent `Dataset` iteration at compile time
   * Monomorphic callsites only, use runtime compilation to either cast each field in `OutputDataset` to its type or at least make sure that there is only one type for each `invokevirtual` call to begin with (in the case of runtime compiled `Dataset` as explained in the Javadoc)
* Avoid instantiating a `TerminalDataset` if we only have a single output
* Compile an iteration free version of `TerminalDataset` if we have multiple outputs
* Pass `RubyArray` instead of `Batch` from Ruby to Java to avoid the redundant `to_a` Java -> Ruby -> Java round trip since we only use the contents of a batch and not the `Batch` instance itself on the Java side (also makes instantiating read batches cheaper)
 
### Some general benchmark results

* Apache Example: Improves significantly relative to the previous Java exec and is measurably faster than Ruby exec now (58k/s vs. 52k/s over largeish sample size)
* Baseline (4 generator threads, 1 worker thread): **biggest improvement here** as expected since only the outputs are optimized using code gen for now, `master` Java exec is at around 350k/s, Ruby is at 360k/s and this branch at 580k/s for Java exec! Workers are a lot faster and less memory hungry now.
* Baseline (1 generator, 1 worker): This case is interesting, it actually gets slower with the Java exec. The reason for this is that the performance of the in-memory queue degrades as soon as outputs start to outpace inputs. This is simply a result of an empty queue likely not filling a batch on the initial `drainTo` call => you need to poll the Queue => you get contention on its lock => writers to the queue wait more often and get throttled. Not much to do here, this is simply the way an `ArrayblockingQueue` works (google ""false sharing"" for the why behind a faster consumer making things slower here overall) and would require some other data structure that comes with more coarse locking on writes. For now, this is a pretty academic example anyways :)
* Optimal worker count and batch size both are higher for Java execution than for Ruby => this is kind of nice (imo), especially when looking at ES output bulk request sizes

### Next Steps (imo)

* Do the same thing I did here and implement more optimal runtime compiled for filter and conditional `Dataset`
* Extract a common abstraction for describing the inputs to compiling a `Dataset` (like what buffers do I need, what `Callsite`s do I invoke and such)
* Use the abstraction to compile every pipeline into just a single method (and be super cache efficient and fast :))"

| Branch?       | 1.7.7.x
| Description?  | The function `hookcount` returns 1 even when no module subscribed to the hook when the hook is present in `hook.xml`. It also does not take into account programmatically subscribed hooks. Therefore, this function should be deprecated and we should look for the content returned by `renderhook` or `renderhookarray` instead.<br>Also, the `displayAdminProductsExtra` hook was missing form `hook.xml`.
| Type?         | bug fix
| Category?     | CO
| BC breaks?    | no
| Deprecations? | yes
| Fixed ticket? | N/A
| How to test?  | 1. Go on the order view page, no empty rectangle below the tabs (status, transport...) should be displayed.<br>2. Go on the product view page, no ""Module"" tab should be displayed.<br>3. Install @Matt75's [module](https://github.com/Matt75/testhookdisplayadminproductsextra/releases), go back on the product view page, you should see the ""Module"" tab.

To ensure information about supported services is as widely distributed as possible. There are currently inconsistencies between pages which has caused confusion when communicating with Adobe Commerce cloud support. I hope to help others avoid this.

## Affected pages
- [Cloud architecture for Commerce](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/architecture/cloud-architecture.html?lang=en#supported-software-and-services) is directly affected
- [System requirements](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-operations/installation-guide/system-requirements.html#system-dependencies) is tangentially affected as the note RE: cloud infrastructure links to the `Cloud architecture for Commerce` page

17168675,PullRequestEvent,"**Problem:**
After a processor sends a ScratchGet command to the scratchpad and receives a response from the main memory,  the data from the main memory is not written to the scratchpad rightly because of the wrong way of initializing the data vector. 
**Solution:**
The original way of initializing the data vector,
`std::vector<uint8_t> data(response->getPayload()[payloadOffset],response->getPayload()[payloadOffset+size]);` may not copy the response's payload to the data vector correctly.  Because this  form of constructor is matched to the second form, the **fill constructor** about constructing a vector in the [cpp reference about vector](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/vector/).
So I modified it to match the third one, the **range constructor** in the [cpp reference about vector](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/vector/).

In this way, it can make my simulation work correct."

49736102,PullRequestEvent,"closes #4492

Ich habe nochmal geschaut, wann wir das Beenden der Session dort eingefügt haben:
https://github.com/redaxo/redaxo/commit/c3e93dbe8903f2790fd66e3644ca1f65e3fd1cd9, als Reaktion auf https://github.com/redaxo/redaxo/issues/150.

Es ging also nicht um technische Gründe, sondern nur um die Unstimmigkeit des ""Zum Login""-Buttons ganz am Ende.

Ich würde das wieder rückgängig machen. Ich finde die Unstimmigkeit nicht so schlimm, dass man bei erneutem Setup dann trotz ""Zum Login""-Buttons direkt im Backend landet.

Man könnte den Button auch umbenennen, wobei auch weiter oben im Text steht, man solle sich einloggen. Siehe https://github.com/redaxo/redaxo/pull/4371.
Ich würde es wohl erstmal einfach so lassen.

Es stellt sich jetzt höchstens die Frage, ob es vielleicht doch auch technische Gründe für das Beenden der Session gibt, auch wenn es nicht die ursprüngliche Intention war.
Mir fällt da aber eigentlich nix ein, und gerade bei erneutem Setup wäre es schon bequem, im Backend zu bleiben."

2222479,PullRequestEvent,"- Dockerfile changes
  - Added .dockerignore so unneded files aren't copied over
  - Smaller docker image using scratch image
  - Binaries are statically linked and build with cgo so that they can run on a scratch image.
  - docker image does run as root (could be a security issue) this could be easily changed but may also be harder to setup for some
 
- Releases
  - When a tag is created github actions will create a release and upload binaries.
  - Binaries for linux and windows are statically linked and built with cgo, so they should have no dependencies.
  - Built with `-extldflags -s -w` flags for a smaller binary this strips dwarf tables used in debuggers and doesn't affect stack traces. 
    - Release Targets:
      - linux-amd64 (tested)
      - linux-arm64 (untested)
      - linux-armv7 (untested)
      - win-amd64 (tested)
      - darwin-amd64 (untested)
  - Docker files will be created and uploaded to docker hub.
  - Tagged latest and with tag
     - linux-amd64 (tested)
     - linux-arm64 (untested)
     - linux-armv7 (untested)

- Continous Integration
  - uses v1.x for latest version of golang
  - added go vet in linting stage
  - go build is run for all release targets as well(maintainers will have access to build artifacts).
  - added docker build and upload to docker hub for push to master, images tagged with commit sha1.

- A go-shiori account will need to be made on docker hub
- A personal access token will need to be created on docker hub
- The following gihub actions secrets will need to be set in github

# [Template] PR Description

In general, github system automatically copies your commit message for your convenience.
Please remove unused part of the template after writing your own PR description with this template.
```bash
$ git commit -s filename1 filename2 ... [enter]

Summarize changes in around 50 characters or less

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of the commit and the rest of the text as the body. The
blank line separating the summary from the body is critical;
various tools like `log`, `shortlog` and `rebase` can get confused 
if you run the two together.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

**Changes proposed in this PR:**
- Bullet points are okay, too
- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
  by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here.

Resolves: #123
See also: #456, #789

extended sensor API with async call
- modified `hts221` sensor to support reading temperature and humidity asynchronously
- modified `samples/sensor/hts221` to work in 2 modes: periodic sensor read from thread or asynchronously from k_timer (interrupt context). I've removed all printing to only get sensor related processing. Sample runs on nordic thingy52 (pca20020).

32481905,PullRequestEvent,"At the root of an inline formatting context, we used its vertical-align in order to compute the strut. That was wrong, since vertical-align on a block container shouldn't affect the contents, it should only affect the alignment of the block container (if it's inline-level) within the parent IFC.

This was only working well if the block container was block-level, since effective_vertical_align_for_inline_layout returned `baseline` for block-level boxes.

Instead of the outer display type, this patch changes the logic to check whether we are at the root of the IFC.

49695357,PullRequestEvent,"PR: remove label upon author reply on review
via `prLabeling/reviewReply.test.ts`"
46721658,PullRequestEvent,"Previously, thick async functions were represented sometimes as a pair
of (AsyncFunctionPointer, nullptr)--when the thick function was produced
via a thin_to_thick_function, e.g.--and sometimes as a pair of
(FunctionPointer, ThickContext)--when the thick function was produced by
a partial_apply--with the size stored in the slot of the ThickContext.

That optimized for the wrong case: partial applies of dynamic async
functions; in that case, there is no appropriate AsyncFunctionPointer to
form when lowering the partial_apply instruction.  The far more common
case is to know exactly which function is being partially applied.  In
that case, we can form the appropriate AsyncFunctionPointer.

Furthermore, the previous representation made calling a thick function
more complex: it was always necessary to check whether the context was
in fact null and then proceed along two different paths depending.

Here, that behavior is corrected by creating a thunk in a mandatory
IRGen SIL pass in the case that the function that is being partially
applied is dynamic.  That new thunk is then partially applied in place
of the original partial_apply of the dynamic function.

This change is WIP.  The following still must be done:
- address temporary hacks and omissions marked with FIXME_NOWs
- finish proper handling of generics
- ensure ownership is correct in thunk
- proper mangling and demangling of the thunk
- write more tests"

46721658,PullRequestEvent,"**Explanation**: Fix a class of overconsumes by teaching the move-only address checker that an instruction can consume multiple fields.

An instruction can consume multiple fields of an aggregate which is being checked.  For example, `apply %fn(%field1, %field3)`.  Where `%field1` and `%field3` are noncontiguous fields of some struct.  

Previously, for a single instruction, the checker only tracked a single contiguous range of bits which the instruction consumed.  It couldn't represent instructions such as this apply.  Consequently, it failed to recognize that fields of the aggregate beyond the first it examined were consumed by the instruction.  The result was an overconsume of each field beyond the first.

Here, this is fixed by associating a vector of bits with each instruction.

<h2>Version 4.7 - released 2021-01-10</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/issues/165"">#165</a>:
CVE-2020-25658 - Bleichenbacher-style timing oracle in PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption
code</li>
<li>Add padding length check as described by PKCS#1 v1.5 (Fixes
<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/issues/164"">#164</a>)</li>
<li>Reuse of blinding factors to speed up blinding operations.
Fixes <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/issues/162"">#162</a>.</li>
<li>Declare &amp; test support for Python 3.9</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.4 &amp; 4.6 - released 2020-06-12</h2>
<p>Version 4.4 and 4.6 are almost a re-tagged release of version 4.2. It requires
Python 3.5+. To avoid older Python installations from trying to upgrade to RSA
4.4, this is now made explicit in the <code>python_requires</code> argument in <code>setup.py</code>.
There was a mistake releasing 4.4 as &quot;3.5+ only&quot;, which made it necessary to
retag 4.4 as 4.6 as well.</p>
<p>No functional changes compared to version 4.2.</p>
<h2>Version 4.3 &amp; 4.5 - released 2020-06-12</h2>
<p>Version 4.3 and 4.5 are almost a re-tagged release of version 4.0. It is the
last to support Python 2.7. This is now made explicit in the <code>python_requires</code>
argument in <code>setup.py</code>. Python 3.4 is not supported by this release. There was a
mistake releasing 4.4 as &quot;3.5+ only&quot;, which made it necessary to retag 4.3 as
4.5 as well.</p>
<p>Two security fixes have also been backported, so 4.3 = 4.0 + these two fixes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose blinding factor relatively prime to N. Thanks Christian Heimes for pointing this out.</li>
<li>Reject cyphertexts (when decrypting) and signatures (when verifying) that have
been modified by prepending zero bytes. This resolves CVE-2020-13757. Thanks
Carnil for pointing this out.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.2 - released 2020-06-10</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rolled back the switch to Poetry, and reverted back to using Pipenv + setup.py
for dependency management. There apparently is an issue no-binary installs of
packages build with Poetry. This fixes
<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/issues/148"">#148</a></li>
<li>Limited SHA3 support to those Python versions (3.6+) that support it natively.
The third-party library that adds support for this to Python 3.5 is a binary
package, and thus breaks the pure-Python nature of Python-RSA.
This should fix <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/issues/147"">#147</a>.</li>
</ul>

When we have different AS number in bird configuration and in APIC BGP route reflector. Some BGP related test cases are still passing. As the ping command works for round trip but not from the interface where we created BGP configuration, so combinedly test getting passed.

### Solution:
I added a condition to check first if the command is to validate BGP session then simply grep ""BGP Error: Bad peer AS"" in the text_area_output. It is the output we print what we run commands inside the remote vm. If BGP AS number is matched, it shows as ""Established"".

### [`v4.0.0`](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;400)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/compare/v3.43.2...v4.0.0)

##### Added

-   A new look for Sourcegraph, previously in beta as ""Simple UI"", is now permanently enabled. [#&#8203;41021](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/41021)
-   A new [multi-version upgrade](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/updates#multi-version-upgrades) process now allows Sourcegraph instances to upgrade more than a single minor version. Instances at version 3.20 or later can now jump directly to 4.0. [#&#8203;40628](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/40628)
-   Matching ranges in file paths are now highlighted for path results and content results. Matching paths in repository names are now highlighted for repository results. [#&#8203;41296](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/41296) [#&#8203;41385](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/41385) [#&#8203;41470](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/41470)
-   Aggregations by repository, file, author, and capture group are now provided for search results. [#&#8203;39643](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/39643)
-   Blob views and search results are now lazily syntax highlighted for better performance. [#&#8203;39563](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/39563) [#&#8203;40263](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/40263)
-   File links in both the search results and the blob sidebar and now prefetched on hover or focus. [#&#8203;40354](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/40354) [#&#8203;41420](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/41420)
-   Negation support for the search predicates `-repo:has.path()` and `-repo:has.content()`. [#&#8203;40283](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/40283)
-   Experimental clientside OpenTelemetry can now be enabled with `""observability.client"": { ""openTelemetry"": ""/-/debug/otlp"" }`, which sends OpenTelemetry to the new [bundled OpenTelemetry Collector](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/observability/opentelemetry). [#&#8203;37907](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/37907)
-   File diff stats are now characterized by 2 figures: lines added and lines removed. Previously, a 3rd figure for lines modified was also used. This is represented by the fields on the `DiffStat` type on the GraphQL API. [#&#8203;40454](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/40454)

##### Changed

-   [Sourcegraph with Kubernetes (without Helm)](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/deploy/kubernetes): The `jaeger-agent` sidecar has been replaced by an [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/observability/opentelemetry) DaemonSet + Deployment configuration. The bundled Jaeger instance is now disabled by default, instead of enabled. [#&#8203;40456](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/40456)
-   [Sourcegraph with Docker Compose](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/deploy/docker-compose): The `jaeger` service has been replaced by an [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/observability/opentelemetry) service. The bundled Jaeger instance is now disabled by default, instead of enabled. [#&#8203;40455](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/40455)
-   `""observability.tracing"": { ""type"": ""opentelemetry"" }` is now the default tracer type. To revert to existing behaviour, set `""type"": ""jaeger""` instead. The legacy values `""type"": ""opentracing""` and `""type"": ""datadog""` have been removed. [#&#8203;41242](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/41242)
-   `""observability.tracing"": { ""urlTemplate"": """" }` is now the default, and if `""urlTemplate""` is left empty, no trace URLs are generated. To revert to existing behaviour, set `""urlTemplate"": ""{{ .ExternalURL }}/-/debug/jaeger/trace/{{ .TraceID }}""` instead. [#&#8203;41242](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/41242)
-   Code host connection tokens are no longer supported as a fallback method for syncing changesets in Batch Changes. [#&#8203;25394](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/25394)
-   **IMPORTANT:** `repo:contains(file:foo content:bar)` has been renamed to `repo:contains.file(path:foo content:bar)`. `repo:contains.file(foo)` has been renamed to `repo:contains.path(foo)`. `repo:contains()` **is no longer a valid predicate. Saved searches using** `repo:contains()` **will need to be updated to use the new syntax.** [#&#8203;40389](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/40389)

##### Fixed

-   Fixed support for bare repositories using the src-cli and other codehost type. This requires the latest version of src-cli. [#&#8203;40863](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/40863)
-   The recommended [src-cli](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/src-cli) version is now reported consistently. [#&#8203;39468](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/39468)
-   A performance issue affecting structural search causing results to not stream. It is much faster now. [#&#8203;40872](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/40872)
-   An issue where the saved search input box reports an invalid pattern type for `standard`, which is now valid. [#&#8203;41068](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/41068)
-   Git will now respect system certificate authorities when specifying `certificates` for the `tls.external` site configuration. [#&#8203;38128](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/38128)
-   Fixed a bug where setting `""observability.tracing"": {}` would disable tracing, when the intended behaviour is to default to tracing with `""sampling"": ""selective""` enabled by default. [#&#8203;41242](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/41242)
-   The performance, stability, and latency of search predicates like `repo:has.file()`, `repo:has.content()`, and `file:has.content()` have been dramatically improved. [#&#8203;418](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/zoekt/pull/418), [#&#8203;40239](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/40239), [#&#8203;38988](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/38988), [#&#8203;39501](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/39501)
-   A search query issue where quoted patterns inside parenthesized expressions would be interpreted incorrectly. [#&#8203;41455](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/41455)

##### Removed

-   `CACHE_DIR` has been removed from the `sourcegraph-frontend` deployment. This required ephemeral storage which will no longer be needed. This variable (and corresponding filesystem mount) has been unused for many releases. [#&#8203;38934](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/38934)
-   Quick links will no longer be shown on the homepage or search sidebar. The `quicklink` setting is now marked as deprecated. [#&#8203;40750](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/40750)
-   Quick links will no longer be shown on the homepage or search sidebar if the ""Simple UI"" toggle is enabled and will be removed entirely in a future release. The `quicklink` setting is now marked as deprecated. [#&#8203;40750](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/40750)
-   `file:contains()` has been removed from the list of valid predicates. `file:has.content()` and `file:contains.content()` remain, both of which work the same as `file:contains()` and are valid aliases of each other.
-   The single-container `sourcegraph/server` deployment no longer bundles a Jaeger instance. [#&#8203;41244](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/41244)
-   The following previously-deprecated fields have been removed from the Batch Changes GraphQL API: `GitBranchChangesetDescription.headRepository`, `BatchChange.initialApplier`, `BatchChange.specCreator`, `Changeset.publicationState`, `Changeset.reconcilerState`, `Changeset.externalState`.

### [`v3.43.2`](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;3432)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/compare/v3.43.1...v3.43.2)

##### Fixed

-   Fixed an issue causing context cancel error dumps when updating a code host config manually. [#&#8203;40857](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/41265)
-   Fixed non-critical errors stopping the repo-syncing process for Bitbucket projectKeys. [#&#8203;40897](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/40582)
-   Fixed an issue marking accounts as expired when the supplied Account ID list has no entries. [#&#8203;40860](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/40860)

### [`v3.43.1`](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;3431)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/compare/v3.43.0...v3.43.1)

##### Fixed

-   Fixed an infinite render loop on the batch changes detail page, causing the page to become unusable. [#&#8203;40857](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/40857)
-   Unable to pick the correct GitLab OAuth for user authentication and repository permissions syncing when the instance configures more than one GitLab OAuth authentication providers. [#&#8203;40897](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/40897)

### [`v3.43.0`](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;3430)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/compare/v3.42.2...v3.43.0)

##### Added

-   Enforce 5-changeset limit for batch changes run server-side on an unlicensed instance. [#&#8203;37834](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/37834)
-   Changesets that are not associated with any batch changes can have a retention period set using the site configuration `batchChanges.changesetsRetention`. [#&#8203;36188](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/36188)
-   Added experimental support for exporting traces to an OpenTelemetry collector with `""observability.tracing"": { ""type"": ""opentelemetry"" }` [#&#8203;37984](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/37984)
-   Added `ROCKSKIP_MIN_REPO_SIZE_MB` to automatically use [Rockskip](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_intelligence/explanations/rockskip) for repositories over a certain size. [#&#8203;38192](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/38192)
-   `""observability.tracing"": { ""urlTemplate"": ""..."" }` can now be set to configure generated trace URLs (for example those generated via `&trace=1`). [#&#8203;39765](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/39765)

##### Changed

-   **IMPORTANT: Search queries with patterns surrounded by** `/.../` **will now be interpreted as regular expressions.** Existing search links or code monitors are unaffected. In the rare event where older links rely on the literal meaning of `/.../`, the string will be automatically quoted it in a `content` filter, preserving the original meaning. If you happen to use an existing older link and want `/.../` to work as a regular expression, add `patterntype:standard` to the query. New queries and code monitors will interpret `/.../` as regular expressions. [#&#8203;38141](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/38141).
-   The password policy has been updated and is now part of the standard featureset configurable by site-admins. [#&#8203;39213](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/39213).
-   Replaced the `ALLOW_DECRYPT_MIGRATION` envvar with `ALLOW_DECRYPTION`. See [updated documentation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/config/encryption). [#&#8203;39984](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/39984)
-   Compute-powered insight now supports only one series custom colors for compute series bars [40038](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/40038)

##### Fixed

-   Fix issue during code insight creation where selecting `""Run your insight over all your repositories""` reset the currently selected distance between data points. [#&#8203;39261](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/39261)
-   Fix issue where symbols in the side panel did not have file level permission filtering applied correctly. [#&#8203;39592](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/39592)

##### Removed

-   The experimental dependencies search feature has been removed, including the `repo:deps(...)` search predicate and the site configuration options `codeIntelLockfileIndexing.enabled` and `experimentalFeatures.dependenciesSearch`. [#&#8203;39742](https://togithub.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/39742)

<!--Tell us what you did and why-->

1. The [compose/reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/) doc isn't up to date as the commands and options it contains are still from [version 1.20.0](https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/blob/12757bf9532d677e83eb35d68fbd0b372baf0e8a/compose/reference/overview.md)
This adds docker-compose command options (flags) that are supported in the last compose V1 version (1.29.2) but not yet in the docs.

2. The `--compatibility` flag is supported in Compose V2 (`docker compose`) but deprecated in Compose V1 (`docker-compose`) and this isn't properly explained in the [compose/cli-command-compatibility](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command-compatibility/) docs.
This properly explains that section preventing issues like #13733

37411558,PullRequestEvent,"- fixes https://github.com/docker/docs/issues/8178
- fixes https://github.com/docker/docs/issues/13152

Opening as draft

In the current reference documentation, separate pages are included for commands that have aliases. For example, a page exists for both `docker run` (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/), and for `docker container run` (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container_run/)

This  situation is confusing, because it's difficult for users to learn that both commands are equivalent, but also because only one page has an extended description (and examples).

This PR:

- updates the YAML docs with YAML generated by https://github.com/docker/cli/pull/2389, which moves the extended descriptions to the `<object>_<verb>.yaml` files
- removes the duplicate pages, instead redirecting all commands to their `<object> <verb>` counterparts
- updates the titles of those pages to include both the short-hand (`docker run`) and long-hand (`docker container run`) commands in the title.

To discuss:

For some commands, the ""short-hand"" may actually be the preferred / canonical command, so instead of redirecting to the `<object>_<verb>` page, we could redirect the other way round (redirect `docker container run` to `docker run`).

I decided not to go that direction, because (even though lengthier to type), the `docker container run` command:

- makes the user end up in the ""container"" sub-section in the navigation
- also has links to ""related"" commands (`docker container stop`, `docker container rm`)

Because of the above, it's easier for users to both ""discover"" related commands, and to understand what type of object the command relates to. The same is less easy to discover with the short-hand commands. For example, to learn that `docker rmi` relates to _images_, whereas `docker rm` relates to _containers_.

### To do

Update `usage` descriptions where possible, for example, the ""usage"" section (and  `--help` output) of `docker run` does not mention the aliases;

```
Usage:	docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]
```

We could probably update those to mention both variations:

```
Usage:	docker container run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]
```

For other commands, there's even more variations (`docker ps`, `docker container ls`, `docker container list`, `docker container ps`); we need to decide what to do with those.

"
37411558,PullRequestEvent,"follow-up to https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/pull/11640 (changes are in the last commit). It's still a WIP, but I had this branch lingering around on my machine as part of other changes, so I thought to push it as a PR to share.

This brings the initial work to redesign our notes and admonitions.

The following adminitions are supported:

- `info`: generic note with ""info"" icon
- `tip`: note  with a ""lightbulb"" icon
- `check`: note with a ""check"" icon
- `important`: note with an exclamation mark
- `warning`: note with an exclamation mark in a triangle

There are some alternative icons that I considered (currently commented in the style-sheet, but to be removed)

Things remaining:

- update the examples and descriptions in ""test.md""
- tweak line-heights / typography
- review uses of ""warning"" versus ""important""; their purpose needs to be defined better (and styled accordingly)
- color-schemes: we can likely use the same colors for ""dark"" and ""light"" mode. There's also some colors (""warning"", e.g.) that use some tweaking.
- add classes to existing notes to switch between a ""regular"" note to notes with an icon (""admonition"").
- removing ""note"" as first line: when using an icon, the icon can replace ""note"" in many cases; removing the ""note"" makes the note more compact without loosing meaning, so we should remove those.
- for other notes, we should do the reverse: replace ""note"" with a more  suitable introduction. I updated some pages to illustrate this. Setting  a more descriptive first line can give notes a better context.


### Examples

Here's some pages that could be used to view the updates styles:

- https://5f9818658b67be00091dbe36--docsdocker.netlify.app/engine/security/https/
- https://5f9818658b67be00091dbe36--docsdocker.netlify.app/engine/install/ubuntu/

Note that --ctorigdstport matches the original destination port of the first packet of the connection, not the packet being filtered. So the dropping rule will also drop responses to the outgoing connections from Docker to the world on 5000-9999! Add --ctdir ORIGINAL to the DROP rule to match only incoming packets. See github.com/moby/moby/issues/22054#issuecomment-466663033

You can also specify which chains docker should use. For example, in the filter table, specify another chain instead of `FORWARD`. This allows you to use traditional tools to manage the firewall and decide when to pass control to docker.

## About The Pull Request

Adds new options to dynamic.json's Dynamic section.

`lowpop_max_traitor_percentage`: The maximum percentage of (living antags / living players) can be before midround traitors, heretics, and all latejoins stop injecting while under ""traitor_percentage_population_threshold"" population.

Default 15%

`traitor_percentage_population_threshold`: The population size where dynamic stops caring about antag percents during injections. This is usually because on higher pop it isn't forced to spawn a bunch of sleeper agents.

Default 30

Basically, at <30 pop, if more than 15% of living players are antags, dynamic will NOT spawn sleepers or latejoin traitors/heretics.


`threat_curve_centre_lowpop_reduction_threshold`: Population at which the threat curve center starts getting reduced by 'threat_curve_lowop_coeff' for every X players under the threshold.

Default 30

`threat_curve_centre_lowpop_reduction_coeff`: The amount the threat curve centre is reduced for every player under 'threat_curve_centre_lowpop_reduction_threshold'

Default 1

Here is what the threat curve reduction looks like. Keep in mind this is the CENTER of the lorentz distribution, which I will include a pic of after.

Basically, the ""middle ground"" threat of 50 is reduced by 1 point for each population it goes down. This does NOT mean that lowpop will never get high threat, just that it's MORE LIKELY to get the middle ground threat, which is now lower.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Dynamic has been spamming sleepers at lowpop because it has nothing else to spend its threat on. Stahp it.

## Changelog
:cl:
balance: Dynamic will not spawn midround traitors, obsessed, or heretics at lowpop if over 15% of the living crew is antag.
balance: Dynamic's threat will now scale the center of the threat curve down by one threat for each player under 30 players readied at roundstart.
fix: Fixed dynamic simulation capping threat based on actual roundstart players ready instead of simulated players ready.

## About The Pull Request

Updates monkey sprites to a semi-modern standard. 

Gives monkeys the option to wear jumpsuits, or any type of ``i_clothing``. 
This is done by clipping down the human worn-sprite and making some slight adjustments through shifting & stretching. This is also applied to hats, bags & masks. 

Monkey-icons are only generated if a monkey tries to equip a piece of clothing. Once an icon has been generated, all similar items will use that icon, instead of making their own, when a monkey equips them.

Additionally introduces a new gimmick role, Experiment. This role will have the player spawn as a monkey with a science outfit & ID.

## Why It's Good For The Game

Improves crusty sprites & emphasizes monkey RP without introducing any force-rp mechanics.

## Testing Photographs and Procedure
<!-- Include any screenshots/videos/debugging steps of the modified code functioning successfully, ideally including edge cases. -->

# Changes
It turns out, `git status -s` fails if the working directory is a ""detached"" head, which is what happens in our case. This removes that checks as it renders `pipeline` not releasable at all.

It also ""locally"" tag it to the specified version so that it will appear in the go build metadata.

43809577,PullRequestEvent,fix #1347 
43809577,PullRequestEvent,"what: Added a new interface method in the job execution repository that retrieves the executions by comparing ID, data job name and data job team. Switched the Spring data interface methods used in the KubernetesService class' cancelJobExecution method. Fixed a few log calls which had reversed variables for printing e.g it would pring the job instead of the team name and vice versa.

why: The previous implementation would only compare for execution ID, allowing users to cancel job executions of other team/job by providing the correct execution. Moreover the default method would produce a query with INNER JOIN data_job datajob1_ on the DataJob table which in some cases would return 404 not found errors when attempting to cancel job executions. After debugging we noticed that the listExecutions method is not affected by this pitfall and it's query uses a LEFT OUTER join, which the new method also uses. Note below is the old findByID method's produced query and the new method's query for comparison:

Hi all,

this is an _automatically_ generated pull request to notify you that there is 1 commit from the branch `jdk:master`that can **not** be merged into the branch `master`:

The following file contains merge conflicts:

- make/modules/java.base/lib/CoreLibraries.gmk

All Committers in this [project](https://openjdk.org/census#mobile) have access to my [personal fork](https://github.com/openjdk-bot/mobile) and can therefore help resolve these merge conflicts (you may want to coordinate who should do this).
The following paragraphs will give an example on how to solve these merge conflicts and push the resulting merge commit to this pull request.
The below commands should be run in a local clone of your [personal fork](https://wiki.openjdk.org/display/skara#Skara-Personalforks) of the [openjdk/mobile](https://github.com/openjdk/mobile) repository.

```bash
# Ensure target branch is up to date
$ git checkout master
$ git pull https://github.com/openjdk/mobile.git master

# Fetch and checkout the branch for this pull request
$ git fetch https://github.com/openjdk-bot/mobile.git +12:openjdk-bot-12
$ git checkout openjdk-bot-12

# Merge the target branch
$ git merge master
```

When you have resolved the conflicts resulting from the `git merge` command above, run the following commands to create a merge commit:

```bash
$ git add paths/to/files/with/conflicts
$ git commit -m 'Merge jdk:master'
```


When you have created the merge commit, run the following command to push the merge commit to this pull request:

```bash
$ git push https://github.com/openjdk-bot/mobile.git openjdk-bot-12:12
```

_Note_: if you are using SSH to push commits to GitHub, then change the URL in the above `git push` command accordingly.

Thanks,
J. Duke

79913779,PullRequestEvent,"This drops the `-lc++` flag from the `LDFLAGS`. I don't recall why we added it at the moment. I have yet to see this be helpful, but I have seen it cause issues. In some cases, one can end up linked to both `libstdc++` and `libc++` with this flag. In other cases, it can cause things that do not have any C++ code to be linked to `libc++`. As a result, I'm proposing that we drop it.

Dependabot has been fully integrated into GitHub, so you no longer have to install and manage a separate app. This pull request migrates your configuration from Dependabot.com to a config file, using the [new syntax][new_syntax]. When merged, we'll swap out `dependabot-preview` (me) for a new `dependabot` app, and you'll be all set!

With this change, you'll now use the [Dependabot page in GitHub][dependabot_page], rather than the [Dependabot dashboard][dashboard], to monitor your version updates, and you'll configure Dependabot through the new config file rather than a UI.







If you've got any questions or feedback for us, please let us know by creating an issue in the [dependabot/dependabot-core][issues] repository.

7975741,PullRequestEvent,updated from 24 hours to 23 hours fix #55
7975741,PullRequestEvent,"removed the flipud, added a test and redid the gold files with the correct topo"
7975741,PullRequestEvent,transitions from bumpversion to setuptools_scm
7975741,PullRequestEvent,"Added more robust testing to AWSM. Borrowed test structure from SMRF

- Lakes basin with HRRR data
- Lakes basin with lidar update
- Lakes basin test initialization from snow.nc or init.nc

Coverage jumped to 79%.

Fix #33 and working towards #71 "
7975741,PullRequestEvent,"AWSM was initially setup with a complex folder structure to account for different potential simulations. While some of it was useful, it created a very deep folder structure. With the IPW version of iSnobal removed from AWSM, this greatly simplifies the folder structure.

All ouput from AWSM will be in the `run<date>` folder instead of split up across 3 different folders.

```
/output

```

This is one of the larger topics in #71 "
7975741,PullRequestEvent,"First pass at cleaning up the `AWSM` class. The `__init__` was quite large, grouped like commands for parsing the config file.

- removed the `wyhr` option for the output folders, `start_end` will be the default
- updated config options `proj` to `project_name` and `desc` to `project_description` #56 
- use SMRF `Topo` class for reading the topo instead of `spatialnc`
- use `xarray` to select the closest time if initializing from a previous `snow.nc` file
- cleaned up the logger a bit
- added timezone information to the start and end dates"
7975741,PullRequestEvent,"### Description Of Changes

- Added the session object to the TDSCatalog to allow for easier session management
- Added test for closing the session

#### Checklist

- [X] Closes #279
- [X] Tests added
- [X] All tests passed

"
7975741,PullRequestEvent,Added an option to output SMRF netcdf files as float (32-bit) or double (64-bit). The default is float (32-bit) and the option for double will be used in AWSM when comparing all the different methods.

We used to have this script https://github.com/dstefanMSFT/active-direcotry-b2b-user-pull as a sample, but it's been 5 years and needed to be updated. The new script has the following improvements:

Use certificate-based authentication instead of app secret

``/System/IOSSupport``, and ``/usr`` other than ``/usr/local``. Previously,
anything under ``/System`` was assumed to be in an SDK which causes problems
with the new file system layout in 10.15+ where user file systems may appear
to be mounted under ``/System``.  Paths in ``/Library`` were also
incorrectly treated as SDK locations.

The rule categorizes requests according to your aggregation criteria, collects them into aggregation instances, and counts and rate limits the requests for each instance.
│    │    │    You can specify individual aggregation keys, like IP address or HTTP method. You can also specify aggregation key combinations, like IP address and HTTP method, or HTTP method, query argument, and cookie.
│    │    │    Each unique set of values for the aggregation keys that you specify is a separate aggregation instance, with the value from each key contributing to the aggregation instance definition.
│    │    │    For example, assume the rule evaluates web requests with the following IP address and HTTP method values:
│    │    │    - IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST
│    │    │    - IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET
│    │    │    - IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST
│    │    │    - IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET
│    │    │    The rule would create different aggregation instances according to your aggregation criteria, for example:
│    │    │    - If the aggregation criteria is just the IP address, then each individual address is an aggregation instance, and AWS WAF counts requests separately for each. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
│    │    │    - IP address 10.1.1.1: count 3
│    │    │    - IP address 127.0.0.0: count 1
│    │    │    - If the aggregation criteria is HTTP method, then each individual HTTP method is an aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
│    │    │    - HTTP method POST: count 2
│    │    │    - HTTP method GET: count 2
│    │    │    - If the aggregation criteria is IP address and HTTP method, then each IP address and each HTTP method would contribute to the combined aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:

│    │    │    - IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST: count 1
│    │    │    For any n-tuple of aggregation keys, each unique combination of values for the keys defines a separate aggregation instance, which AWS WAF counts and rate-limits individually.
│    │    │    You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts and rate limits requests that match the nested statement. You can use this nested scope-down statement in conjunction with your aggregation key specifications or you can just count and rate limit all requests that match the scope-down statement, without additional aggregation. When you choose to just manage all requests that match a scope-down statement, the aggregation instance is singular for the rule.
│    │    │    You cannot nest a `RateBasedStatement` inside another statement, for example inside a `NotStatement` or `OrStatement` . You can define a `RateBasedStatement` inside a web ACL and inside a rule group.
│    │    │    For additional information about the options, see [Rate limiting web requests using rate-based rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rate-based-rules.html) in the *AWS WAF Developer Guide* .

This option is not available for other aggregation configurations.
│    │    │    AWS WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each instance of a rate-based rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking and management by AWS WAF .

│         ├[~] type RateBasedStatement
│         │ └  - documentation: A rate-based rule counts incoming requests and rate limits requests when they are coming at too fast a rate. The rule categorizes requests according to your aggregation criteria, collects them into aggregation instances, and counts and rate limits the requests for each instance.
│         │    You can specify individual aggregation keys, like IP address or HTTP method. You can also specify aggregation key combinations, like IP address and HTTP method, or HTTP method, query argument, and cookie.
│         │    Each unique set of values for the aggregation keys that you specify is a separate aggregation instance, with the value from each key contributing to the aggregation instance definition.
│         │    For example, assume the rule evaluates web requests with the following IP address and HTTP method values:
│         │    - IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST
│         │    - IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET
│         │    - IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST
│         │    - IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET
│         │    The rule would create different aggregation instances according to your aggregation criteria, for example:
│         │    - If the aggregation criteria is just the IP address, then each individual address is an aggregation instance, and AWS WAF counts requests separately for each. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
│         │    - IP address 10.1.1.1: count 3
│         │    - IP address 127.0.0.0: count 1
│         │    - If the aggregation criteria is HTTP method, then each individual HTTP method is an aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
│         │    - HTTP method POST: count 2
│         │    - HTTP method GET: count 2
│         │    - If the aggregation criteria is IP address and HTTP method, then each IP address and each HTTP method would contribute to the combined aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
│         │    - IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST: count 1
│         │    - IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET: count 2
│         │    - IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST: count 1
│         │    For any n-tuple of aggregation keys, each unique combination of values for the keys defines a separate aggregation instance, which AWS WAF counts and rate-limits individually.
│         │    You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts and rate limits requests that match the nested statement. You can use this nested scope-down statement in conjunction with your aggregation key specifications or you can just count and rate limit all requests that match the scope-down statement, without additional aggregation. When you choose to just manage all requests that match a scope-down statement, the aggregation instance is singular for the rule.
│         │    You cannot nest a `RateBasedStatement` inside another statement, for example inside a `NotStatement` or `OrStatement` . You can define a `RateBasedStatement` inside a web ACL and inside a rule group.
│         │    For additional information about the options, see [Rate limiting web requests using rate-based rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rate-based-rules.html) in the *AWS WAF Developer Guide* .
│         │    If you only aggregate on the individual IP address or forwarded IP address, you can retrieve the list of IP addresses that AWS WAF is currently rate limiting for a rule through the API call `GetRateBasedStatementManagedKeys` . This option is not available for other aggregation configurations.
│         │    AWS WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each instance of a rate-based rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking and management by AWS WAF . If you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use that rule group in multiple places, each use creates a separate instance of the rate-based rule that gets its own tracking and management by AWS WAF .

Closes #29044.

### Reason for this change

When associating between the source GraphQL API and the merged API using `fromSourceApis`, generated association resource doesn't depend on the source GraphQL schema.

```ts
// This API has `CfnGraphQLSchema` by `definition` prop
const firstApi = new appsync.GraphqlApi(stack, 'FirstSourceAPI', {
  name: 'FirstSourceAPI',
  definition: appsync.Definition.fromFile(path.join(__dirname, 'appsync.merged-api-1.graphql')),
});

// This merged API generates `CfnSourceApiAssociation`
new appsync.GraphqlApi(stack, 'MergedAPI', {
  name: 'MergedAPI',
  definition: appsync.Definition.fromSourceApis({
    sourceApis: [
      {
        sourceApi: firstApi,
        mergeType: appsync.MergeType.MANUAL_MERGE,
      },
    ],
  }),
});
```

The same is true if the `SourceApiAssociation` construct is used explicitly.

```ts
// This API has `CfnGraphQLSchema` by `definition` prop
const firstApi = new appsync.GraphqlApi(stack, 'FirstSourceAPI', {
  name: 'FirstSourceAPI',
  definition: appsync.Definition.fromFile(path.join(__dirname, 'appsync.merged-api-1.graphql')),
});

// This merged API does not generate `CfnSourceApiAssociation`
const mergedApi = new appsync.GraphqlApi(stack, 'MergedAPI', {
  name: 'MergedAPI',
  definition: appsync.Definition.fromSourceApis({
    sourceApis: [],
    mergedApiExecutionRole: mergedApiExecutionRole,
  }),
});

// This construct has `CfnSourceApiAssociation`
new appsync.SourceApiAssociation(stack, 'SourceApiAssociation1', {
  sourceApi: firstApi,
  mergedApi: mergedApi,
  mergeType: appsync.MergeType.MANUAL_MERGE,
  mergedApiExecutionRole: mergedApiExecutionRole,
});
```

### Description of changes

The `sourceApi` passed by the `fromSourceApis` method or the `SourceApiAssociation` construct has `addSchemaDependency` method. Using this method, we can make the association to depend on the schema in the `sourceApi`.
But, if the api is an IMPORTED resource to begin with, it has no schema in the CDK layer, so there is nothing we can do about it. (The method does nothing.)

### Description of how you validated changes

Both unit and existing integ tests.

Closes #29071

Reason for this change
The method reusableBind on DefaultStackSynthesizer which is intended to copy the current DefaultStackSynthesizer ends up returning an instance with a reference to the AssetManifestBuilder instance. All stacks end up sharing the same asset manager and additional assets end up in the wrong stacks.

Description of changes
The method reusableBind now instantiates a new AssetManifestBuild eliminating the problem.

Description of how you validated changes
I have added a unit test which fails if my changes are not included. In addition I took the questionable cowboy approach of verifying the code change by changing minified code for default-stack-synthesizer.ts in a test project.

  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 5.0.3
   ```
   ==========================

*March 4, 2024*

Django 5.0.3 fixes a security issue with severity &quot;moderate&quot; and several bugs
in 5.0.2.

CVE-2024-27351: Potential regular expression denial-of-service in ``django.utils.text.Truncator.words()``
=========================================================================================================

``django.utils.text.Truncator.words()`` method (with ``html=True``) and
:tfilter:`truncatewords_html` template filter were subject to a potential
regular expression denial-of-service attack using a suitably crafted string
(follow up to :cve:`2019-14232` and :cve:`2023-43665`).

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed a regression in Django 5.0.2 where ``intcomma`` template filter could
  return a leading comma for string representation of floats (:ticket:`35172`).

* Fixed a bug in Django 5.0 that caused a crash of ``Signal.asend()`` and
  ``asend_robust()`` when all receivers were asynchronous functions
  (:ticket:`35174`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 5.0.1 where :meth:`.ModelAdmin.lookup_allowed`
  would prevent filtering against foreign keys using lookups like ``__isnull``
  when the field was not included in :attr:`.ModelAdmin.list_filter`
  (:ticket:`35173`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 5.0 that caused a crash of
  ``sensitive_variables`` and ``sensitive_post_parameters`` decorators on
  functions loaded from ``.pyc`` files (:ticket:`35187`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 5.0 that caused a crash when reloading a test
  database and a base queryset for a base manager used ``prefetch_related()``
  (:ticket:`35238`).

* Fixed a bug in Django 5.0 where facet filters in the admin would crash on a
  ``SimpleListFilter`` using a queryset without primary keys (:ticket:`35198`).

This PR updates [mypy](https://pypi.org/project/mypy) from **1.6.1** to **1.9.0**.



<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>
  
  
   ### 1.9
   ```
   We’ve just uploaded mypy 1.9 to the Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mypy/)). Mypy is a static type checker for Python. This release includes new features, performance improvements and bug fixes. You can install it as follows:

    python3 -m pip install -U mypy

You can read the full documentation for this release on [Read the Docs](http://mypy.readthedocs.io).

 Breaking Changes

Because the version of typeshed we use in mypy 1.9 doesn&#x27;t support 3.7, neither does mypy 1.9. (Jared Hance, PR [16883](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16883))

We are planning to enable
[local partial types](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/command_line.html#cmdoption-mypy-local-partial-types) (enabled via the
`--local-partial-types` flag) later this year by default. This change
was announced years ago, but now it&#x27;s finally happening. This is a
major backward-incompatible change, so we&#x27;ll probably include it as
part of the upcoming mypy 2.0 release. This makes daemon and
non-daemon mypy runs have the same behavior by default.

Local partial types can also be enabled in the mypy config file:

local_partial_types = True


We are looking at providing a tool to make it easier to migrate
projects to use `--local-partial-types`, but it&#x27;s not yet clear whether
this is practical. The migration usually involves adding some
explicit type annotations to module-level and class-level variables.

 Basic Support for Type Parameter Defaults (PEP 696)

This release contains new experimental support for type parameter
defaults ([PEP 696](https://peps.python.org/pep-0696)). Please try it
out! This feature was contributed by Marc Mueller.

Since this feature will be officially introduced in the next Python
feature release (3.13), you will need to import `TypeVar`, `ParamSpec`
or `TypeVarTuple` from `typing_extensions` to use defaults for now.

This example adapted from the PEP defines a default for `BotT`:
python
from typing import Generic
from typing_extensions import TypeVar

class Bot: ...

BotT = TypeVar(&quot;BotT&quot;, bound=Bot, default=Bot)

class Context(Generic[BotT]):
    bot: BotT

class MyBot(Bot): ...

 type is Bot (the default)
reveal_type(Context().bot)
 type is MyBot
reveal_type(Context[MyBot]().bot)

   ### 1.7
   ```
   We’ve just uploaded mypy 1.7 to the Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mypy/)). Mypy is a static type checker for Python. This release includes new features, performance improvements and bug fixes. You can install it as follows:

    python3 -m pip install -U mypy

You can read the full documentation for this release on [Read the Docs](http://mypy.readthedocs.io).

 Using TypedDict for `**kwargs` Typing

Mypy now has support for using `Unpack[...]` with a TypedDict type to annotate `**kwargs` arguments enabled by default. Example:

python
 Or &#x27;from typing_extensions import ...&#x27;
from typing import TypedDict, Unpack

class Person(TypedDict):
    name: str
    age: int

def foo(**kwargs: Unpack[Person]) -&gt; None:
    ...

foo(name=&quot;x&quot;, age=1)   Ok
foo(name=1)   Error


The definition of `foo` above is equivalent to the one below, with keyword-only arguments `name` and `age`:

python
def foo(*, name: str, age: int) -&gt; None:
    ...


Refer to [PEP 692](https://peps.python.org/pep-0692/) for more information. Note that unlike in the current version of the PEP, mypy always treats signatures with `Unpack[SomeTypedDict]` as equivalent to their expanded forms with explicit keyword arguments, and there aren&#x27;t special type checking rules for TypedDict arguments.

This was contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi back in 2022 (PR [13471](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/13471)).

 TypeVarTuple Support Enabled (Experimental)

Mypy now has support for variadic generics (TypeVarTuple) enabled by default, as an experimental feature. Refer to [PEP 646](https://peps.python.org/pep-0646/) for the details.

TypeVarTuple was implemented by Jared Hance and Ivan Levkivskyi over several mypy releases, with help from Jukka Lehtosalo.

Changes included in this release:

 * Fix handling of tuple type context with unpacks (Ivan Levkivskyi, PR [16444](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16444))

 New Way of Installing Mypyc Dependencies

If you want to install package dependencies needed by mypyc (not just mypy), you should now install `mypy[mypyc]` instead of just `mypy`:


python3 -m pip install -U &#x27;mypy[mypyc]&#x27;


Mypy has many more users than mypyc, so always installing mypyc dependencies would often bring unnecessary dependencies.

This change was contributed by Shantanu (PR [16229](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16229)).

 New Rules for Re-exports

Mypy no longer considers an import such as `import a.b as b` as an explicit re-export. The old behavior was arguably inconsistent and surprising. This may impact some stub packages, such as older versions of `types-six`. You can change the import to `from a import b as b`, if treating the import as a re-export was intentional.

This change was contributed by Anders Kaseorg (PR [14086](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14086)).

 Improved Type Inference

The new type inference algorithm that was recently introduced to mypy (but was not enabled by default) is now enabled by default. It improves type inference of calls to generic callables where an argument is also a generic callable, in particular. You can use `--old-type-inference` to disable the new behavior.

The new algorithm can (rarely) produce different error messages, different error codes, or errors reported on different lines. This is more likely in cases where generic types were used incorrectly.

The new type inference algorithm was contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi. PR [16345](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16345) enabled it by default.

 Narrowing Tuple Types Using len()

Mypy now can narrow tuple types using `len()` checks. Example:

python
def f(t: tuple[int, int] | tuple[int, int, int]) -&gt; None:
    if len(t) == 2:
        a, b = t    Ok
    ...


This feature was contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi (PR [16237](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16237)).

 More Precise Tuple Lengths (Experimental)

Mypy supports experimental, more precise checking of tuple type lengths through `--enable-incomplete-feature=PreciseTupleTypes`. Refer to the [documentation](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_line.html#enabling-incomplete-experimental-features) for more information.

More generally, we are planning to use `--enable-incomplete-feature` to introduce experimental features that would benefit from community feedback.

This feature was contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi (PR [16237](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16237)).

 Mypy Changelog

We now maintain a [changelog](https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) in the mypy Git repository. It mirrors the contents of [mypy release blog posts](https://mypy-lang.blogspot.com/). We will continue to also publish release blog posts. In the future, release blog posts will be created based on the changelog near a release date.

This was contributed by Shantanu (PR [16280](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16280)).

    calls instead of crashing.
  * Reduce the size of generated proto headers for protos with `string` or
    `bytes` fields.
  * Move arena() operation on uncommon path to out-of-line routine
  * For iterator-pair function parameter types, take both iterators by value.
  * Code-space savings and perhaps some modest performance improvements in
    RepeatedPtrField.
  * Eliminate nullptr check from every tag parse.
  * Remove unused _$name$_cached_byte_size_ fields.
  * Serialize extension ranges together when not broken by a proto field in the
    middle.

  * Fix undefined behavior warning due to innocuous uninitialization of value
    on an error path.
  * Avoid expensive inlined code space for encoding message length for messages

    Subclasses should inherit from SimpleFieldComparator instead.

  Java:
  * Detect invalid overflow of byteLimit and return InvalidProtocolBufferException as documented.

2020-07-14 version 3.13.0 (C++/Java/Python/PHP/Objective-C/C/Ruby/JavaScript)

  PHP:
  * The C extension is completely rewritten. The new C extension has significantly
    better parsing performance and fixes a handful of conformance issues. It will
    also make it easier to add support for more features like proto2 and proto3 presence.
  * The new C extension does not support PHP 5.x. PHP 5.x users can still use pure-PHP.

  C++:
  * Removed deprecated unsafe arena string accessors
  * Enabled heterogeneous lookup for std::string keys in maps.
  * Removed implicit conversion from StringPiece to std::string
  * Fix use-after-destroy bug when the Map is allocated in the arena.
  * Improved the randomness of map ordering
  * Added stack overflow protection for text format with unknown fields
  * Use std::hash for proto maps to help with portability.
  * Added more Windows macros to proto whitelist.
  * Arena constructors for map entry messages are now marked &quot;explicit&quot;
    (for regular messages they were already explicit).
  * Fix subtle aliasing bug in RepeatedField::Add
  * Fix mismatch between MapEntry ByteSize and Serialize with respect to unset
    fields.

  Python:
  * JSON format conformance fixes:
    * Reject lowercase t for Timestamp json format.
    * Print full_name directly for extensions (no camelCase).
    * Reject boolean values for integer fields.
    * Reject NaN, Infinity, -Infinity that is not quoted.
    * Base64 fixes for bytes fields: accept URL-safe base64 and missing padding.
  * Bugfix for fields/files named &quot;async&quot; or &quot;await&quot;.
  * Improved the error message when AttributeError is returned from __getattr__
    in EnumTypeWrapper.

  Java:
  * Fixed a bug where setting optional proto3 enums with setFooValue() would
    not mark the value as present.
  * Add Subtract function to FieldMaskUtil.

  C:
  * Dropped support for netstandard1.0 (replaced by support for netstandard1.1).
    This was required to modernize the parsing stack to use the `Span&lt;byte&gt;`
    type internally. (7351)
  * Add `ParseFrom(ReadOnlySequence&lt;byte&gt;)` method to enable GC friendly
    parsing with reduced allocations and buffer copies. (7351)
  * Add support for serialization directly to a `IBufferWriter&lt;byte&gt;` or
    to a `Span&lt;byte&gt;` to enable GC friendly serialization.
    The new API is available as extension methods on the `IMessage` type. (7576)
  * Add `GOOGLE_PROTOBUF_REFSTRUCT_COMPATIBILITY_MODE` define to make
    generated code compatible with old C compilers (pre-roslyn compilers
    from .NET framework and old versions of mono) that do not support
    ref structs. Users that are still on a legacy stack that does
    not support C 7.2 compiler might need to use the new define
    in their projects to be able to build the newly generated code. (7490)
  * Due to the major overhaul of parsing and serialization internals (7351 and 7576),
    it is recommended to regenerate your generated code to achieve the best
    performance (the legacy generated code will still work, but might incur
    a slight performance penalty).

2020-07-28 version 3.12.4 (C++/Java/Python/PHP/Objective-C/C/Ruby/JavaScript)

  * Removed the internal-only header coded_stream_inl.h and the internal-only methods defined there.
  * Enforced no SWIG wrapping of descriptor_database.h (other headers already had this restriction).
  * Implementation of the equivalent of the MOMI parser for serialization. This removes one of the two serialization routines, by making the fast array serialization routine completely general. SerializeToCodedStream can now be implemented in terms of the much much faster array serialization. The array serialization regresses slightly, but when array serialization is not possible this wins big. 
  * Do not convert unknown field name to snake case to accurately report error.

  * Fail fast for better performance in DescriptorPool::FindExtensionByNumber() if descriptor has no defined extensions.
  * Adding the file name to help debug colliding extensions

    The latter will replace Reflection::FindKnownExtensionByName().
  * Replace NULL with nullptr
  * Created a new Add method in repeated field that allows adding a range of elements all at once.
  * Enabled enum name-to-value mapping functions for C++ lite

  * Update GSON version to 3.8.5. (6268)
  * Add `protobuf_java_lite` Bazel target. (6177)

  Python
  * Change implementation of Name() for enums that allow aliases in proto2 in Python
    to be in line with claims in C++ implementation (to return first value).
  * Explicitly say what field cannot be set when the new value fails a type check.
  * Duplicate register in descriptor pool will raise errors
  * Add __slots__ to all well_known_types classes, custom attributes are not allowed anymore.

2019-04-29 version 3.8.0 (C++/Java/Python/PHP/Objective-C/C/Ruby/JavaScript)

  C++
  * Use std::atomic&lt;int32&gt; in case of myriad2 platform
  * Always declare enums to be int-sized
  * Added DebugString() and ShortDebugString() methods on MessageLite
  * Specialized different parse loop control flows
  * Make hasbits potentially in register. The or&#39;s start forming an obstacle because it&#39;s a read modify store on the same mem address on each iteration.
  * Move to an internal MACRO for parser validity checks.
  * Improve map parsing performance.
  * Make MergePartialFromCodedStream non virtual. This allows direct calls, potential inlining and is also a code health improvement
  * Add an overall limit to parse_context to prevent reading past it. This allows to remove a annoying level of indirection.
  * Fix a mistake, we shouldn&#39;t verify map key/value strings for utf8 in opt mode for proto2.
  * Further improvements to cut binary size.
  * Prepare to make MergePartialFromCodedStream non-virtual.
  * A report on some interesting behavior change in python (caused by b/27494216) made me realize there is a check that needs to be done in case the parse ended on a end group tag.
  * Add a note of caution to the comments around skip in CodedOutputStream.
  * Simplify end check.
  * Add overload for ParseMessage for MessageLite/Message types. If the explicit type is not known inlining won&#39;t help de-virtualizing the virtual call.
  * Reduce linker input. It turns out that ParseMessage is not inlined, producing  template instantiations that are used only once and save nothing but cost more.
  * Improve the parser.
  * [c++17] Changed proto2::RepeatedPtrField iterators to no longer derive from the deprecated std::iterator class.
  * Change the default value of case_insensitive_enum_parsing to false for JsonStringToMessage.
  * Add a warning if a field name doesn&#39;t match the style guide.

  * Fix MSVC warning C4244 in protobuf&#39;s parse_context.h.
  * Updating Iterators to be compatible with C++17 in MSVC.
  * Use capability annotation in mutex.h
  * Fix &quot;UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer: cfi-bad-type&quot;
  * CriticalSectionLock class as a lightweight replacement for std::mutex on Windows platforms.
  * Removed vestigial wire_format_lite_inl.h

  C
  * Added System.Memory dependency.

  Java
  * Make Java protoc code generator ignore optimize_for LITE_RUNTIME. Users should instead use the Java lite protoc plugin.
  * Change Extension getMessageDefaultInstance() to return Message instead of MessageLite.
  * Prevent malicious input streams from leaking buffers for ByteString or ByteBuffer parsing.

    planned for the near future:
      - Preserve unknown fields in proto3: please read this doc:

          https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KMRX-G91Aa-Y2FkEaHeeviLRRNblgIahbsk4wA14gRk/view

        for the timeline and follow up this github issue:

          https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/272

        for discussion.
      - Make C++ implementation C++11 only: we plan to require C++11 to build
        protobuf code starting from 3.4.0 or 3.5.0 release. Please join this
        github issue:

          https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/2780

        to provide your feedback.

  C++
  * Fixed map fields serialization of DynamicMessage to correctly serialize
    both key and value regardless of their presence.
  * Parser now rejects field number 0 correctly.
  * New API Message::SpaceUsedLong() that’s equivalent to
    Message::SpaceUsed() but returns the value in size_t.
  * JSON support
    - New flag always_print_enums_as_ints in JsonPrintOptions.
    - New flag preserve_proto_field_names in JsonPrintOptions. It will instruct
      the JSON printer to use the original field name declared in the .proto
      file instead of converting them to lowerCamelCase when printing JSON.
    - JsonPrintOptions.always_print_primtive_fields now works for oneof message
      fields.
    - Fixed a bug that doesn’t allow different fields to set the same json_name
      value.
    - Fixed a performance bug that causes excessive memory copy when printing
      large messages.
  * Various performance optimizations.

  Java
  * Map field setters eagerly validate inputs and throw NullPointerExceptions
    as appropriate.

  * descriptor_pool.FindFileContainingSymbol() now is able to find nested
    extensions.
  * Extending empty [] to repeated field now sets parent message presence.

    fractional seconds.
  * Added GPBMessageDropUnknownFieldsRecursively() to remove unknowns from a
    message and any sub messages.
  * Addressed a threading race in extension registration/lookup.
  * Increased the max message parsing depth to 100 to match the other languages.
  * Removed some use of dispatch_once in favor of atomic compare/set since it
    needs to be heap based.
  * Fixes for new Xcode 8.3 warnings.

    value.
  * Added JSON formatting option to format enums as integers.
  * Modified RepeatedField&lt;T&gt; to implement IReadOnlyList&lt;T&gt;.
  * Introduced the start of custom option handling; it&#39;s not as pleasant as it
    might be, but the information is at least present. We expect to extend code
    generation to improve this in the future.
  * Introduced ByteString.FromStream and ByteString.FromStreamAsync to
    efficiently create a ByteString from a stream.
  * Added whole-message deprecation, which decorates the class with [Obsolete].

  Ruby
  * Fixed Messageto_h for messages with map fields.
  * Fixed memcpy() in binary gems to work for old glibc, without breaking the
    build for non-glibc libc’s like musl.

  Javascript
  * Added compatibility tests for version 3.0.0.
  * Added conformance tests.
  * Fixed serialization of extensions: we need to emit a value even if it is
    falsy (like the number 0).
  * Use closurebuilder.py in favor of calcdeps.py for compiling JavaScript.

2017-01-23 version 3.2.0 (C++/Java/Python/PHP/Ruby/Objective-C/C/JavaScript/Lite)
  General

    protoc plugin to detect which version of protoc is used with the plugin and
    mitigate known problems in certain version of protoc.

  C++
  * The default parsing byte size limit has been raised from 64MB to 2GB.
  * Added rvalue setters for non-arena string fields.
  * Enabled debug logging for Android.
  * Fixed a double-free problem when using Reflection::SetAllocatedMessage()
    with extension fields.

  * Fixed generated code to support field numbers up to 2^29-1.

  Python
  * You can now assign NumPy scalars/arrays (np.int32, np.int64) to protobuf
    fields, and assigning other numeric types has been optimized for
    performance.
  * Pure-Python: message types are now garbage-collectable.
  * Python/C++: a lot of internal cleanup/refactoring.

  PHP (Alpha)
  * For 64-bit integers type (int64/uint64/sfixed64/fixed64/sint64), use PHP
    integer on 64-bit environment and PHP string on 32-bit environment.
  * PHP generated code also conforms to PSR-4 now.
  * Fixed ZTS build for c extension.
  * Fixed c extension build on Mac.
  * Fixed c extension build on 32-bit linux.

  * Message names Empty will be converted to GPBEmpty in generated code.
  * Added phpdoc in generated files.
  * The released API is almost stable. Unless there is large problem, we won&#39;t
    change it. See
    https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/php-generated
    for more details.

  Objective-C
  * Added support for push/pop of the stream limit on CodedInputStream for
    anyone doing manual parsing.

  C

  Javascript
  * Deserialization of repeated fields no longer has quadratic performance
    behavior.
  * UTF-8 encoding/decoding now properly supports high codepoints.
  * Added convenience methods for some well-known types: Any, Struct, and
    Timestamp. These make it easier to convert data between native JavaScript
    types and the well-known protobuf types.

2016-09-23 version 3.1.0 (C++/Java/Python/PHP/Ruby/Objective-C/C/JavaScript/Lite)
  General
  * Proto3 support in PHP (alpha).
  * Various bug fixes.

  C++
  * Added MessageLite::ByteSizeLong() that’s equivalent to
    MessageLite::ByteSize() but returns the value in size_t. Useful to check
    whether a message is over the 2G size limit that protobuf can support.

    addresses to be known at compile time.
  * Adding missing generic gcc 64-bit atomicops.
  * Restore New*Callback into google::protobuf namespace since these are used
    by the service stubs code
  * JSON support.
    * Fixed some conformance issues.
  * Fixed a JSON serialization bug for bytes fields.

  Java
  * Fixed a bug in TextFormat that doesn’t accept empty repeated fields (i.e.,
    “field: [ ]”).
  * JSON support
    * Fixed JsonFormat to do correct snake_case-to-camelCase conversion for
      non-style-conforming field names.
    * Fixed JsonFormat to parse empty Any message correctly.
    * Added an option to JsonFormat.Parser to ignore unknown fields.
  * Experimental API
    * Added UnsafeByteOperations.unsafeWrap(byte[]) to wrap a byte array into
      ByteString without copy.

  Python
  * JSON support
    * Fixed some conformance issues.

  PHP (Alpha)
  * We have added the proto3 support for PHP via both a pure PHP package and a
    native c extension. The pure PHP package is intended to provide usability
    to wider range of PHP platforms, while the c extension is intended to
    provide higher performance. Both implementations provide the same runtime
    APIs and share the same generated code. Users don’t need to re-generate
    code for the same proto definition when they want to switch the
    implementation later. The pure PHP package is included in the php/src
    directory, and the c extension is included in the php/ext directory.

    Both implementations provide idiomatic PHP APIs:
    * All messages and enums are defined as PHP c"

73116608,PullRequestEvent,"This is the main body of the JEP 450: Compact Object Headers (Experimental).

Main changes:
 - Introduction of the (experimental) flag UseCompactObjectHeaders. All changes in this PR are protected by this flag.
 - The compressed Klass* can now be stored in the mark-word of objects. In order to be able to do this, we are building on #10907, #13582 and #13779 to protect the relevant (upper 32) bits of the mark-word. Significant parts of this PR deal with loading the compressed Klass* from the mark-word, and dealing with (monitor-)locked objects. When the object is monitor-locked, we load the displaced mark-word from the monitor, and load the compressed Klass* from there. This PR also changes some code paths (mostly in GCs) to be more careful when accessing Klass* (or mark-word or size) to be able to fetch it from the forwardee in case the object is forwarded, and/or reach through to the monitor when the object is locked by a monitor.
 - The identity hash-code is narrowed to 25 bits.
 - Instances can now have their base-offset (the offset where the field layouter starts to place fields) at offset 8 (instead of 12 or 16).
 - Arrays will can now store their length at offset 8. Due to alignment restrictions, array elements will still start at offset 16. #11044 will resolve that restriction and allow array elements to start at offset 12 (except for long, double and uncompressed oops, which are still required to start at an element-aligned offset).
 - CDS can now write and read archives with the compressed header. However, it is not possible to read an archive that has been written with an opposite setting of UseCompactObjectHeaders.

Testing:
 (+UseCompactObjectHeaders tests are run with the flag hard-patched into the build, to also catch @flagless tests, and to avoid mismatches with CDS - see above.)

If this PR is associated with an issue be sure to reference it
by including ""refs #<issue>"" or ""closes #<issue>"" (e.g., #closes #1234).

If this PR implements an enhancement that does not have an existing issue, please add the following:
-->

## Reason
<!--Why do you need this feature or what is the enhancement?-->
Our downstream pipelines are being failed by an issue with Yum in Docker for CentOS when trying to install Perl packages for assessing code coverage.  Basically, per the issue linked at the bottom of this comment, the `appstream` repository immediately times out, even on the base image `centos:8`.

## Design
<!--A concise description (design) of the enhancement.-->
In `docker_ci/yum_installs.sh`, the lines from [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/70930049) StackOverflow answer have been added before the package manager is first invoked.

## Impact
<!--Will the enhancement change existing APIs or add something new?-->
No change to the source, just ensuring Yum will work for CentOS Docker builds.  Closes #20194.

<!--
If this PR implements a bug fix, please create an issue for the bug and reference the issue.

## About The Pull Request

[Design Document (Read this for more information)](https://hackmd.io/@ L9JPMsZhRO2wI25rNI6GYg/rkYKM9Yc6)

This PR adds Spies as a new roundstart antagonist type, inspired by Spy-Thiefs from Goonstation.

Spies are tasked with stealing various objects around the station, from insulated gloves to the black box, from the clown's left leg to the bridge's communications console. 

For every item stolen, the Spy is rewarded with a random item from the Syndicate Uplink, plus some items uniquely available to the Spy. Stolen items are then shipped off and sold on the Black Market Uplink, allowing the crew - or maybe some other evil-doers - to get their hands on them. 

![image](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/assets/51863163/f057d480-4545-44da-b8fe-a8d09a5d2dcf)

More ideas for theft items and bounties are welcome. 

## Why It's Good For The Game

See the design document for more information. 

In short: Adds a solo antagonist which has less impact than your Traitors and Heretics, but more impact than Paradox Clones and Thieves. In other words: On the same tier as old traitors. 

Seeks to embrace the sandbox aspect of antagonists more by having no precise greentext objective, and instead some suggestions for chaos you can embark in. Have fun with it!

## Changelog

:cl: Melbert
add: Spies may now roam the halls of Space Station 13. Watch your belongings closely.

## About The Pull Request
Meth, maints tar, synaptizine, and nicotine now all use the `AdjustAllImmobility` to handle their stun reductions, instead of individually adjusting all 5-6 immobility effects. `AllImmobility`, `SetAllImmobility`, and `AdjustAllImmobility` now also affect the unconscious status effect as well. I'm calling this a bug/consistency issue, since every chem that didn't already use `AdjustAllImmobility` was adjusting the unconscious status effect anyway, and they are all clearly trying to do the same thing. 

If I missed anything that could also be replaced with `AdjustAllImmobility`, let me know and I'll fix it.
## Why It's Good For The Game
Makes things more consistent, and consistency is good.
## Changelog
:cl:
code: Chem stun reductions are now applied more consistently.
fix: Chem stun reductions should now more consistently apply to unconsciousness.

26440463,PullRequestEvent,"**Description of changes:**
I made changes to strategies to be used to calculate the earliest next load time for playlists in DefaultHlsPlaylistTracker. This change allows for rebuffering reduction with connections to some networks, including but not limited to VDMS, by allowing for the tracker to be more chatty by allowing for playlists to be loaded sooner than what is set for the playlist's target duration.  Additionally, making the tracker more chatty can have the effect of essentially disabling carrier network forced middlebox-forced Slow-Start Restart (SSR). (Refer to the citation below for more information)

The previous implementation is still the default implementation, now provided by DefaultHlsPlaylistTrackerStrategy, when another strategy has not been provided.

**UML Diagram:**
I provided a UML diagram to help provide an understanding of the changes.
[ExoPlayer HlsPlaylistTrackerStrategy.pdf](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/files/3292380/ExoPlayer.HlsPlaylistTrackerStrategy.pdf)

**Citation:**
""We devised a simple way to that requires a minor modification to existing video streaming client software. Our solution comes from the observation that Slow-Start is restarted when a TCP connection goes idle for a duration exceeding a timeout period. Therefore to avoid restarting Slow-Start, we modified the video client to perform frequent micro-fetches (i.e., download 1-byte files) whenever the application is idle between downloading video segments. We verified that this ""chatty"" video streaming application effectively disables middlebox-forced SSR.""

39074581,PullRequestEvent,"One of the things to come out of #7584 is that rating and star badges don't have any explicit `cacheLength` set on them so they just use the default (120 sec). I've never bothered setting one because we serve so few of these in the grand scheme of things. In terms of the way we characterise badges based on how often we expect the values to change and how precise the values need to be, it is probably most sensible to think of these in the same bucket as a download counts.
I don't expect this to make much difference to our performance/load because they make up such a small proportion of our traffic, but it will reduce the amount of traffic on upstream APIs a bit."

Expand the manual configuration section a bit, to mention WebSockets support as well as the existing `protocol` property.

I've also tried to structure it more clearly and to be consistent with the quoting.
I know this is subjective, and there may be a style guide that I could have missed. Sorry if that's the case :(

53064849,PullRequestEvent,"**Description:**

Sometimes when using the template sensor it is very necessary to get the state of its inaccessibility.
For example, if you use the template sensor as a source in the utility meter, when the source data for the template sensor is temporarily unavailable, the calculation in the utility meter is seriously lost (because at this moment the value of the template sensor becomes zero for an instant).

To work correctly with such cases, I added a template for the status of sensor availability. I am sure it will also be useful in many other cases. For example, if you need to temporarily ignore some values ​​in further calculations inside HA.

43336822,PullRequestEvent,"I decided to show a complete static method in the example, so it could be copied to user utility class as is. Not sure if it's reasonable to add `assert cls.isRecord();` there. Also I don't know whether there's a limitation on max characters in the sample code. Probable a line break in `static <T extends Record>\nConstructor<T> getCanonicalConstructor(Class<T> cls)` is unnecessary.

---
Aside from this PR, I've found a couple of things to clean up in `java.lang.Class`:
1. There's erroneous JavaDoc link in `getSimpleName()` JavaDoc (introduced by @jddarcy in #3038). It should be `#isArray()` instead of `isArray()`.
2. Methods Atomic::casAnnotationType and Atomic::casAnnotationData have unused type parameters `<T>`.
3. Probably too much but AnnotationData can be nicely converted to a record! Not sure, probably nobody wants to have `java.lang.Record` initialized too early or increasing the footprint of such a basic class in the metaspace, so I don't insist on this.

```java
    private record AnnotationData(
        Map<Class<? extends Annotation>, Annotation> annotations,
        Map<Class<? extends Annotation>, Annotation> declaredAnnotations,
        // Value of classRedefinedCount when we created this AnnotationData instance
        int redefinedCount) {
    }
```

Please tell me if it's ok to fix 1 and 2 along with this PR.

7779494,PullRequestEvent,"## Description of change

Between Juju 2.5 and 2.6, model-upgrader manifold and related were renamed to environ-upgrader. This was done to cater for CAAS needs but is no longer required and could be confusing.
This PR reverts this renaming."
7779494,PullRequestEvent,"## Description of change

This PR updates the deploy command logic to emit an error when the operator attempts to deploy 
bundles that contain one or more apps that require trusted access to cloud credentials . Each application/service within a bundle can request trust by:

- definining `trust: true` at the application specification block level, OR
- by including a `trust: true` config option

The extra logic introduced by this PR is hidden behind the `trusted-bundles` feature flag as trust is still a work-in-progress feature.

NOTE: This PR only implements the error-emitting logic. A separate PR will introduce a mechanism for the operator to indicate that they indeed trust the apps requiring access to credentials.

## QA steps

```console
$ juju bootstrap lxd test --no-gui

$ export JUJU_DEV_FEATURE_FLAGS=trusted-bundles

# Deploy a bundle with a single app requiring trust
$ juju deploy testcharms/charm-repo/bundle/aws-integrator-trust-single/bundle.yaml
ERROR Bundle cannot be deployed without trusting applications with your cloud credentials.
Please repeat the deploy command with the --trust argument if you consent to trust the following application(s):
  - aws-integrator

# Deploy bundle with multiple apps requiring trust
$ juju deploy testcharms/charm-repo/bundle/aws-integrator-trust-multi/bundle.yaml
ERROR Bundle cannot be deployed without trusting applications with your cloud credentials.
Please repeat the deploy command with the --trust argument if you consent to trust the following application(s):
  - aws-integrator
  - gcp-integrator

# Finally, deploy a bundle with a single app requiring trust via a config option
$ juju deploy testcharms/charm-repo/bundle/aws-integrator-trust-conf-param/bundle.yaml
ERROR Bundle cannot be deployed without trusting applications with your cloud credentials.

This patch implements the `InstanceFirewaller` interface on the `ociInstance` type. It uses the `SshInstanceConfigurator` to manipulate IP tables via SSH.

## QA steps

The `assess-network-health` functional test will pass for the OCI provider. In manual steps this is:
- Bootstrap to OCI
- `juju deploy ubuntu -n 2`.
- `juju deploy '~juju-qa/network-health'`.
- `juju expose ubuntu`.
- `juju expose network-health`.
- `juju add-relation ubuntu network-health`.
- `juju run --unit ubuntu/0 curl <public IP of machine 1>:8039`.
- Ensure the result is ""pass"".

The version **0.10.0** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

If you don’t accept this pull request, your project will work just like it did before. However, you might be missing out on a bunch of new features, fixes and/or performance improvements from the dependency update.

It might be worth looking into these changes and trying to get this project onto the latest version of electron-i18n.

If you have a solid test suite and good coverage, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes directly by merging the proposed change into your project. If the build fails or you don’t have such unconditional trust in your tests, this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

28546240,PullRequestEvent,"This PR is to correct a bug that is present in tf.histogram_fixed_width_bins. The issue was described in https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/29661.

When the elements of `value_range` are same and matches with one or more of the elements in input array `values`, then the index of the element will be outside `nbins`."
28546240,PullRequestEvent,"The current API of `TFRecordOptions` only supports:
- no compression
- GZIP compression
- ZLIB compression

With this PR, I have added support for a 4th compression algorithm, ZSTD: https://github.com/facebook/zstd/

The API for `TFRecordOptions` is therefore updated to accept the following parameters:

```
      compression_type: `""GZIP""`, `""ZLIB""`, `""ZSTD""` or `""""` (no compression).
      zstd_input_buffer_size: int or `None`. 
      zstd_output_buffer_size: int or `None`.
      zstd_flush_mode: int or `None`.
      zstd_nb_workers: int or `None`.
      zstd_compression_level: 0 to 19, or `None`. Default: ZSTD_CLEVEL_DEFAULT.
      zstd_compression_strategy: 0 to 9, or `None`. Default: 0.
      zstd_window_log: between ZSTD_WINDOWLOG_MIN and ZSTD_WINDOWLOG_MAX. Default: 0.
```

Maintaining backward compatibility with the current API.

28546240,PullRequestEvent,As discussed in #2169 
28546240,PullRequestEvent,"When events are created with _r by users like this https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/85c8b2a817f95a3e979ecd1ed95bff1dc1335cff/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/training.py#L1098, [it indicates they are root events](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/v2.4.0/tensorflow/core/profiler/utils/xplane_schema.cc#L168).
Thus those user-specified root events should be processed as root events in the first place. 

However according to current processing order, [they are the last group of events to be processed](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/v2.4.0/tensorflow/core/profiler/utils/group_events.cc#L616). If any event fits into any of the preceding criteria of root events, they will be processed as root, [then the function will return](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/v2.4.0/tensorflow/core/profiler/utils/group_events.cc#L603), skipping the subsequent user-specified root events processing, which is undesirable.

One consequence is when events like [these](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/v2.4.1/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/training.py#L1093) are not processed as root events, it breaks profiler's overview page as the profiler overview page relies on the root events and their step numbers to collect per-step time breakdown."

28546240,PullRequestEvent,Issue: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/19228
50967743,PullRequestEvent,"Depends on, and refines #16126 (which added option `Set Extraction Output Directory`).

This PR adds an option `-output-directory` (with word `directory` in full to be consistent with using a full word in option `Set Extraction Output Directory` in #16126, and more generally with the general use of non-abbreviated words in commands) with synonym `-output-dir` (to be consistent with other command line options such as `-native-output-dir`).

This option is used by default for extraction (when `Extraction Output Directory` is unset), `Redirect ""file""`, and `Print Universes ""file""` when `""file""` is not an absolute path.

Together with #16126, this should provide:
- an indirect answer to #8649 which asks for a way to `Redirect` relatively to the repository where the `.vo` file is output
- to remove the command `Cd` #16119 (or to replace it by an option `Set Output Directory` interactively mimicking `-output-directory`, though this might not be what most developers would recommend) 

Closes #8649

Open questions:
- Mentioned in #8052 (dune) but I'm not specialist of dune.
- Can it have an effect on #4953 (validity of filenames for `Redirect`/`Extraction`)?
- Should we have also more specific options `-redirect-output-directory`, `-extraction-output-directory`?"

The previous code was making some other coercions (particularly `Coercion foo := bar.` but not `Coercion foo : bar >-> baz.`) reversible by default. The new behavior should be closer from the spec in the doc.

25904340,PullRequestEvent,"Chained backend must be updated to accept the new format for Vault's `CheckPolicies` API. Now, this API accepts multiple request contexts, sent as an array, and returns an array of array, containing authorization results for each request context param. This is not properly supported by Cloudserver (8.x) because the `_mergePolicies` function was not updated.

This bugfix will help handling this case, while keeping the previous behavior. The output is still an array, where all the permissions are de-duplicated.

A new unit test was added to test this case.

The change was tested in cloudserver: https://github.com/scality/cloudserver/pull/4818 (green builds in 8.4 and w/8.5/improvement/CLDSRV-286-bump-arsenal-fix-authz-regression)

26586327,PullRequestEvent,"This pr adds a new route `api/simulate/:owner/:repo/:number/status`. This route requires a GitHub token with access to read the repo. We read the repo instead of checking user oauth scopes to better accommodate both `personal` and `server-to-server` tokens.

When called with a valid token, policy-bot will re-evaluate the policy of the referenced pr and return the result without writing the status back to the pull request.

```json
{""status"":""pending"",""description"":""0/1 rules approved""}
```

The handler supports a number of query parameters which when passed can modify the simulated pull request state, adding simulated reviews, ignoring existing ones or changing the `base branch`.

Supported Query Params:
`ignore`: will ignore all reviews and comments by the supplied user.
`review`: will simulate adding an additional approved review by the supplied user.
`comment`: will simulate adding an additional approved review comment by the supplied user.
`branch`: will simulate using a different base branch for the policy config.

If no additional query parameters are specified, the pull request will be evaluated as is."

26586327,PullRequestEvent,"Slack treats private channels (Groups) differently from public channels (Channels) when getting usergroup details (https://api.slack.com/types/usergroup) storing them in two separate slices (prefs.channels and prefs.groups), but then treats them as a single value (""channels"") when pushing an update to the usergroup via the usergroup.update method (https://api.slack.com/methods/usergroups.update).

2 years ago when I added this, I mistakenly only accounted for the public channels which are stored in the Prefs.Channels value when combining to update the default channels in a usergroup.  Really what needs to be done is to combine the public channels and private channel ID's (Prefs.Channels and Prefs.Groups) together before pushing that back to Slack or you could inadvertently remove private channels (groups) from a usergroup.

##### Pull Request Guidelines

These are recommendations for pull requests.
They are strictly guidelines to help manage expectations.

##### PR preparation
Run `make pr-prep` from the root of the repository to run formatting, linting and tests.

##### Should this be an issue instead
- [ ] is it a convenience method? (no new functionality, streamlines some use case)
- [ ] exposes a previously private type, const, method, etc.
- [ ] is it application specific (caching, retry logic, rate limiting, etc)
- [ ] is it performance related.

##### API changes

Since API changes have to be maintained they undergo a more detailed review and are more likely to require changes.

- no tests, if you're adding to the API include at least a single test of the happy case.
- If you can accomplish your goal without changing the API, then do so.
- dependency changes. updates are okay. adding/removing need justification.

###### Examples of API changes that do not meet guidelines:
- in library cache for users. caches are use case specific.
- Convenience methods for Sending Messages, update, post, ephemeral, etc. consider opening an issue instead.

43336896,PullRequestEvent,"This PR is synchronizing the compiler with the spec, in particular with this portion of section `15.13.1 Compile-Time Declaration of a Method Reference`:

```
– If the method reference expression has the form ClassType ::
  [TypeArguments] new , then the potentially applicable methods are a set of
  notional methods corresponding to the constructors of ClassType.
  If ClassType is a raw type, but is not a non- static member type of a raw type,
  the candidate notional member methods are those specified in §15.9.3 for a
  class instance creation expression that uses <> to elide the type arguments to a
  class. Otherwise, the candidate notional member methods are the constructors
  of ClassType, treated as if they were methods with return type ClassType.
```
so javac should treat the code below as a raw constructor invocation:

```
class Outer<T> {
    class Inner<U> {}

    Supplier<Outer<T>.Inner<String>> s = Outer.Inner::new;
}
```
currently javac is rejecting this code

43336896,PullRequestEvent,"The standard doclet works by creating `HtmlDocument` objects and then writing them out. Writing them can be safely done on a separate thread, and doing so results in about an 8% speedup, by overlapping the write/IO time with the time to generate the next page to be written.

The overall impact on the codebase is deliberately small, coming down to a critical `if` statement in `HtmlDocletWriter` to ""write now"" or ""write later"". As such, it is easy to disable the feature if necessary, although no issues have been found in practice. The background writer uses an `ExecutorService`, which provides a lot of flexibility, but experiments show that it is sufficient to use a single background thread and to block if new tasks come available while writing a file.

The feature is ""default on"", with a hidden option to disable it if necessary.

C2 tries to generate a null-check for the get-static in `clzTwo = clzOne;`,  because it thinks that ciKlass of `java.lang.Class` is not loaded.

When `CodeDependenciesTest.foo` is compiled, the classloader of the holder of this method is AppClassLoader, so it finds `java.lang.Class` in AppClassLoader, and finds nothing, so it thinks that `java.lang.Class` is not loaded, but `java.lang.Class` is a built-in class which is definitely loaded and initialized.

The following patch is the first patch we implemented, it tries to find Klass in the parent classloader when the Klass can not be found in current classloader. But the patch has potential risk, because user-defined classloader may not follow the 'parent delegation' style of classloading. 
```

When the Klass of the field is not loaded, the generated 'null check' helps nothing, we think remove it is the right way to avoid the deoptmization.

53030124,PullRequestEvent,"This test will be used to enforce intentional growth in metrics footprint across Istio releases. In prior releases, we have seen growth in the metrics surface, primarily from new envoy metrics exposed via istio-agent. This test (and subsequent changes to it) should help enforce better stability and care over increases in surface.

This PR is for [issue#39800](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/39800). After some investigation, I found the root cause is incorrect listener configuration for service entry.

The address should not be `0.0.0.0` for the service entry in IPv6 only cluster.

53030124,PullRequestEvent,"Fixes: https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/35833 (to avoid breaking change, 15004 port is still supported in this PR)

The changes are as follows:
- `tap service` (previously only using 15004 port) is served on 15004 as well as the status port (15020).
- `tap_proxy.go` is moved to `pilot/cmd/pilot-agent/status/debugtap/proxy.go`.
- Due to the import cycle, `pilot/cmd/pilot-agent/status/server.go` is moved to `pilot/cmd/pilot-agent/status/server/server.go`, and only the parts which are shared with the other packages are exposed in `pilot/cmd/pilot-agent/status/status.go`.
- `tap service` can be disabled by `PROXY_XDS_DEBUG_VIA_AGENT` on both of 15004 and 15020
- If `PROXY_XDS_DEBUG_VIA_AGENT_PORT` is set to `0`, the status port is only used for serving `tap service`.

4502793,PullRequestEvent,"We've now updated liferay-npm-scripts to use Prettier (https://prettier.io/) for JS source formatting. This commit updates our dependency and runs `yarn format` on every project that has a ""package.json"" file, as well as from the top level ""modules/"" folder to cover everything else.

I used [this Bash](https://gist.github.com/wincent/6eb84ca6e5f7185eb8049e4bd04805f7) script to find all the package.json files that have a ""liferay-npm-scripts format"" key, and run `yarn format` from those places, verifying that they work if run independently.

Note that because ""modules/"" has such a package.json file, this means that I effectively confirmed that formatted everything from the top-level as works as well.

I had to add a three ""npmscripts.config.js"" files to locations where we either don't have any JS source files (and therefore have to instruct Prettier to not run), or where we need to pass a special glob (this is the case at ""modules/"" because we want to format everything, even JS that may not have a corresponding ""package.json"" file, but we want to exclude stuff under ""classes/""). Includes a `.prettierrc.js` config file which should be picked up by most people's editors. This merely exposes the definitive config from liferay-npm-scripts.

I deleted some malformed files that were test fixtures and which Prettier would otherwise reject; these actually became unreferenced in 8e62321471f6b7d373 anyway:

- modules/apps/frontend-js/frontend-js-loader-modules-extender/src/test/resources/com/liferay/frontend/js/loader/modules/extender/internal/dependencies/config1.js
- modules/apps/frontend-js/frontend-js-loader-modules-extender/src/test/resources/com/liferay/frontend/js/loader/modules/extender/internal/dependencies/config2.js
- modules/apps/frontend-js/frontend-js-loader-modules-extender/src/test/resources/com/liferay/frontend/js/loader/modules/extender/internal/dependencies/empty.js
- modules/apps/frontend-js/frontend-js-loader-modules-extender/src/test/resources/com/liferay/frontend/js/loader/modules/extender/internal/dependencies/malformed.js

I also removed non-standard ESLint config from a couple of places (segments-web and analytics-client-js). All of this is going to go through liferay-npm-scripts, where we will configure it in such a way that it leaves the formatting-related aspects to prettier and only deals with non-presentational code issues."

I've run into an interesting problem, if the schema name is something similar to a java class name we use in the generated classes it generates a compile error, such as `Collection` as a DTO in our API and `java.util.Collection`. Thinking ahead I changed the `Collection` to `java.util.Collection` in the generated classes to avoid possible errors in the future. I've asked @nhpatt to verify this change and he agreed with it.

The following error goes unnoticed

The `Playbook` func from pkg/ansible/ansible.go is returning a nil error and hence the kubetest2 deployer is proceeding further looking for kubeconfig. Thus the below **wrong error message**:

</ul>
<p>The alpine base has been updated so that we can no longer install to system python with pip. The fix is to install and use a virtual environment. This is a major enough change to the base container that I'm bumping the minor.</p>

<blockquote>
<h2>24.2.0</h2>
<h3>Stable style</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where comments where mistakenly removed along with redundant parentheses
(<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/psf/black/issues/4218"">#4218</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Preview style</h3>
<ul>
<li>Move the <code>hug_parens_with_braces_and_square_brackets</code> feature to the unstable style
due to an outstanding crash and proposed formatting tweaks (<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/psf/black/issues/4198"">#4198</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where base expressions caused inconsistent formatting of ** in tenary
expression (<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/psf/black/issues/4154"">#4154</a>)</li>
<li>Checking for newline before adding one on docstring that is almost at the line limit
(<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/psf/black/issues/4185"">#4185</a>)</li>
<li>Remove redundant parentheses in <code>case</code> statement <code>if</code> guards (<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/psf/black/issues/4214"">#4214</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix issue where <em>Black</em> would ignore input files in the presence of symlinks (<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/psf/black/issues/4222"">#4222</a>)</li>
<li><em>Black</em> now ignores <code>pyproject.toml</code> that is missing a <code>tool.black</code> section when
discovering project root and configuration. Since <em>Black</em> continues to use version
control as an indicator of project root, this is expected to primarily change behavior
for users in a monorepo setup (desirably). If you wish to preserve previous behavior,
simply add an empty <code>[tool.black]</code> to the previously discovered <code>pyproject.toml</code>
(<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/psf/black/issues/4204"">#4204</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Output</h3>
<ul>
<li>Black will swallow any <code>SyntaxWarning</code>s or <code>DeprecationWarning</code>s produced by the <code>ast</code>
module when performing equivalence checks (<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/psf/black/issues/4189"">#4189</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Integrations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add a JSONSchema and provide a validate-pyproject entry-point (<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/psf/black/issues/4181"">#4181</a>)</li>
</ul>

This is less common after #93155 because that PR greatly reduced the total amount of indentation, but the ""vertical smear mode"" failure mode is still just as present when you have deeply nested modules, functions, or trait impls, such as in the case of macro-expanded code from `-Zunpretty=expanded`.

Vertical smear mode is never the best way to format highly indented code though. It does not prevent the target line width from being exceeded, and it produces output that is less readable than just a longer line.

This PR makes the pretty printing algorithm allow a minimum of 60 chars on every line independent of indentation. So as code gets more indented, the right margin eventually recedes to make room for formatting without vertical smear.

41170217,PullRequestEvent,"Provides the ability to speed up notebook execution tests by substituting smaller values for parameters that impact the runtime of the notebook.  To do this one supplies a file for a given `.ipynb` test with the same prefix but the `.tst` suffix.  This file contains replacements of the form `pattern->replacement`.  Some notes

* Suffix `.tst` chosen instead of `.test` because the later has the potential to make some grepping for tests less reliable and more noise prone
* All the patterns must be applied during the test. This avoids the common case of a pattern being a typo and not being applied.
* Open to different syntax than `->`.  Used it because it seemed unlikely to conflict with actual patterns and was indicative of what the replacement is actually doing.  

Notebook tests are taking up to 30 minutes in Google Actions.  This PR gets that down to around 11.  Nearly as fast as the Windows test :)

I think the prerequisite should say “An existing App Service Container” or “An existing Linux Docker Container on Azure App Service.”  It needs to be more clear that the article is talking about a Docker container.

When Andy and I have some time, we’ll try the “Azure App Service Container” option again and use that article you sent us to mount the blob storage.

34194823,PullRequestEvent,"Thank you so much for making this library!

I was trying to run baselines using this library's ""conv_encoder"" architecture for the VAE and noticed that that architecture (including in the publicly available models at, for example, https://storage.googleapis.com/disentanglement_lib/unsupervised_study_v1/0.zip) don't seem to match the architecture described in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12359.pdf in Table 2 of the appendix.

In particular, it looks like the last two Conv2D embedding layers have a kernel of 2x2 instead of 4x4.

I have no idea if it makes any important difference, but my intuition is telling me that 4x4 might make more sense (as shown in the attached pull request), so will probably make that change on my end. I just wanted to reach out and see if you would possibly have time to check my thought process there.

24444246,PullRequestEvent,"fixes #12439 (but really just for contributors)

See https://github.com/nolanlawson/marky/issues/18 for the issue in node 16 (introduced in https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/37970).

However as noted by @patrickhulce in https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/issues/596#issuecomment-832006808, `lighthouse-logger` currently uses `marky@^1.2.0`, so any downstream project just needs to refresh their deps and they'll pick up 1.2.2.

However, contributors (with a git repo checkout) _are_ subject to our `yarn.lock` files for dependencies, so we do need to update those for us."

**JS refactor:** After [connor raised the question](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11732#discussion_r606377369), I tried out the JS approach to see. I'm fine with either, so if folks prefer the JS style, wfm.

**adornments [idea](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11732#issuecomment-814359015)**: the data side of it was annoying enough to split into this. The UI bit seems interesting, no strong feelings, tbh.

This changes how numbers with the '_byte_' itemType are formatted when viewed. 

Previously `2.5` and `1` when formatted with a granularity of `0.1` would be shown as `2.5 KiB` and `1 KiB`. Now they would be formatted as `2.5 KiB` and `1.0 KiB`.

Two approaches tried in this PR:
1. Wrap output stream with `Channels.newChannel()` and `BlobDownloadAsyncResponse.writeTo(channel)`
2. Add dedicated APIs to write to output stream across the board.

**It seems that adding dedicated APIs for OutputStreams across the layers is better because JDK's wrapper adds synchronization which isn't necessary for those scenarios, see https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/739769c8fc4b496f08a92225a12d07414537b6c0/src/java.base/share/classes/java/nio/channels/Channels.java#L454 .**

Environment: Development

Steps to reproduce:
- Navigate to the tag slug page
- Observe the 404 error response

Expected result: The tag slug page should be accessible and display the correct content.
Actual result: The tag slug page returns a 404 error.

And I haven't tested it in the production environment yet.

57515506,PullRequestEvent,Resolves #5 btw.
57515506,PullRequestEvent,"This PR is just for testing branch protection rules and stuff. Don't worry, this PR is being blocked from merging to prevent chaos."
24802730,PullRequestEvent,"See the coverage report by running `yarn test:e2e && yarn coverage`. If you're on macOS, your browser should open automatically with the report. If you're on Linux, you'll have to open the `coverage/index.html` manually.

I was having a hard time picturing just what our test coverage was through our custom testrunner, so I set out to add support for automated coverage collection.

Because the testrunner runs a separate Jest process inside each test subpackage, and because Jest cannot be configured to collect coverage outside the package it is running in, I had to add `nyc` (Istanbul's CLI) and proxy the call to Jest through it. Then I needed to use Istanbul's API to merge the resulting coverage reports into a single summary.

I removed most of the dependencies (including Jest itself) from the test subpackages, because there is not much reason to duplicate these as node module resolution has no problem finding them in the root package, and the test suites are an order of magnitude faster this way. I'm tempted to just remove all dependencies from each subpackage and just install them on the root instead, then we could eliminate the `yarn install` step altogether if we wanted. If we for some reason need to test specific dependency versions differently between test suites, we can always add dependencies back in, and this also helps us be very explicit in that circumstance.

The only difference in test behaviour now that we're resolving most dependencies from the root `node_modules` is that these dependencies are now locked in the lockfile (they were before too, but that was because we were erroneously removing `yarn-lock.json` instead of `yarn.lock`; I've fixed that in this PR). This helps us have more deterministic builds, but if we don't actually want that and want to always test the latest version of each package it's simple enough to remove the lockfile and run `yarn install --no-lockfile` in CI.

`BUILD_COMMAND`に`npm install`や`npm ci`が定義されている場合に、以下のコマンドが付与されることを抑制する。
これにより、予期しないインストールプロセスが動いてしまうことを防ぐ。(ex. `--ignore-scripts`)
- `npm install`
- `npm install --production` (`DELETE_NODE_MODULES`が`true`でないとき)

close #455 

## Changes: 変更内容
- `utils/misc.ts`の`getBuildCommands`内にある`hasInstallCommand`の条件式を下記のように変更
  - Before: `BUILD_COMMAND`に定義されたコマンド内に`npm run install`または`yarn install`を含む
  - After: `BUILD_COMMAND`に定義されたコマンド内に${pkgManager} install`または`npm ci`のいずれかを含む

## Expected Impact: 影響範囲
`BUILD_COMMAND`に`npm install`や`npm ci`を定義していた場合、今まで実行されていた`npm install`コマンドが実行されなくなる。
ただ今までの動作がバグ的挙動であるため、実際に影響を受ける可能性は軽微である。

- uses: technote-space/release-github-actions@v8
  with:
    BUILD_COMMAND: npm ci --ignore-scripts && npm run build
```
- 現行で実行されるコマンド
  - `npm install`
  - `npm ci --ignore-scripts`
  - `npm run build`
  - `rm -rdf node_modules`
  - `npm install --production`
- 修正後に実行されるコマンド
  - `npm ci --ignore-scripts`
  - `npm run build`

今までのビルド動作が`npm install`部分(≒`postinstall`などで実行されるnpm script)に依存していた場合に、破壊的変更となる。

<!-- Explanation of the change or anything fishy that is going on -->

### Fixed Issues
<!---
1. Please postfix `$` with a URL link to the GitHub issue this Pull Request is fixing. For example, `$ https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/<issueID>`.
2. Please postfix  `PROPOSAL:` with a URL link to your GitHub comment, which contains the approved proposal (i.e. the proposal that was approved by Expensify).  For example, `PROPOSAL: https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/<issueID>#issuecomment-1369752925`

Do NOT add the special GH keywords like `fixed` etc, we have our own process of managing the flow.
It MUST be an entire link to the github issue and your comment proposal ; otherwise, the linking and its automation will not work as expected.

Make sure this section looks similar to this (you can link multiple issues using the same formatting, just add a new line):

$ https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/<issueID>
$ https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/<issueID(comment)>

Do NOT only link the issue number like this: $ #<issueID>

### Tests
<!---
Add a numbered list of manual tests you performed that validates your changes work on all platforms, and that there are no regressions present.
Add any additional test steps if test steps are unique to a particular platform.
Manual test steps should be written so that your reviewer can repeat and verify one or more expected outcomes in the development environment.

For example:
1. Click on the text input to bring it into focus
2. Upload an image via copy paste
3. Verify a modal appears displaying a preview of that image
--->

- [x] Verify that no errors appear in the JS console

### Offline tests
<!---
Add any relevant steps that validate your changes work as expected in a variety of network states e.g. ""offline"", ""spotty connection"", ""slow internet"", etc. Manual test steps should be written so that your reviewer and QA testers can repeat and verify one or more expected outcomes. If you are unsure how the behavior should work ask for advice in the `#expensify-open-source` Slack channel.
--->

### QA Steps
<!---
Add a numbered list of manual tests that can be performed by our QA engineers on the staging environment to validate that your changes work on all platforms, and that there are no regressions present.
Add any additional QA steps if test steps are unique to a particular platform.
Manual test steps should be written so that the QA engineer can repeat and verify one or more expected outcomes in the staging environment.

-->

- [x] I linked the correct issue in the `### Fixed Issues` section above
- [x] I wrote clear testing steps that cover the changes made in this PR
    - [x] I added steps for local testing in the `Tests` section
    - [x] I added steps for the expected offline behavior in the `Offline steps` section
    - [x] I added steps for Staging and/or Production testing in the `QA steps` section
    - [x] I added steps to cover failure scenarios (i.e. verify an input displays the correct error message if the entered data is not correct)
    - [x] I turned off my network connection and tested it while offline to ensure it matches the expected behavior (i.e. verify the default avatar icon is displayed if app is offline)
    - [x] I tested this PR with a [High Traffic account](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md#high-traffic-accounts) against the staging or production API to ensure there are no regressions (e.g. long loading states that impact usability).
- [x] I included screenshots or videos for tests on [all platforms](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md#make-sure-you-can-test-on-all-platforms)
- [x] I ran the tests on **all platforms** & verified they passed on:
    - [x] Android: Native
    - [x] Android: mWeb Chrome
    - [x] iOS: Native
    - [x] iOS: mWeb Safari
    - [x] MacOS: Chrome / Safari
    - [x] MacOS: Desktop
- [x] I verified there are no console errors (if there's a console error not related to the PR, report it or open an issue for it to be fixed)
- [x] I followed proper code patterns (see [Reviewing the code](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md#reviewing-the-code))
    - [x] I verified that any callback methods that were added or modified are named for what the method does and never what callback they handle (i.e. `toggleReport` and not `onIconClick`)
    - [x] I verified that the left part of a conditional rendering a React component is a boolean and NOT a string, e.g. `myBool && <MyComponent />`.
    - [x] I verified that comments were added to code that is not self explanatory
    - [x] I verified that any new or modified comments were clear, correct English, and explained ""why"" the code was doing something instead of only explaining ""what"" the code was doing.
    - [x] I verified any copy / text shown in the product is localized by adding it to `src/languages/*` files and using the [translation method](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/4bd99402cebdf4d7394e0d1f260879ea238197eb/src/components/withLocalize.js#L60)
      - [x] If any non-english text was added/modified, I verified the translation was requested/reviewed in #expensify-open-source and it was approved by an internal Expensify engineer. Link to Slack message:
    - [x] I verified all numbers, amounts, dates and phone numbers shown in the product are using the [localization methods](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/4bd99402cebdf4d7394e0d1f260879ea238197eb/src/components/withLocalize.js#L60-L68)
    - [x] I verified any copy / text that was added to the app is grammatically correct in English. It adheres to proper capitalization guidelines (note: only the first word of header/labels should be capitalized), and is either coming verbatim from figma or has been approved by marketing (in order to get marketing approval, ask the Bug Zero team member to add the Waiting for copy label to the issue)
    - [x] I verified proper file naming conventions were followed for any new files or renamed files. All non-platform specific files are named after what they export and are not named ""index.js"". All platform-specific files are named for the platform the code supports as outlined in the README.
    - [x] I verified the JSDocs style guidelines (in [`STYLE.md`](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/STYLE.md#jsdocs)) were followed
- [x] If a new code pattern is added I verified it was agreed to be used by multiple Expensify engineers
- [x] I followed the guidelines as stated in the [Review Guidelines](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md)
- [x] I tested other components that can be impacted by my changes (i.e. if the PR modifies a shared library or component like `Avatar`, I verified the components using `Avatar` are working as expected)
- [x] I verified all code is DRY (the PR doesn't include any logic written more than once, with the exception of tests)
- [x] I verified any variables that can be defined as constants (ie. in CONST.js or at the top of the file that uses the constant) are defined as such
- [x] I verified that if a function's arguments changed that all usages have also been updated correctly
- [x] If any new file was added I verified that:
    - [x] The file has a description of what it does and/or why is needed at the top of the file if the code is not self explanatory
- [x] If a new CSS style is added I verified that:
    - [x] A similar style doesn't already exist
    - [x] The style can't be created with an existing [StyleUtils](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/styles/utils/index.ts) function (i.e. `StyleUtils.getBackgroundAndBorderStyle(theme.componentBG)`)
- [x] If the PR modifies code that runs when editing or sending messages, I tested and verified there is no unexpected behavior for all supported markdown - URLs, single line code, code blocks, quotes, headings, bold, strikethrough, and italic.
- [x] If the PR modifies a generic component, I tested and verified that those changes do not break usages of that component in the rest of the App (i.e. if a shared library or component like `Avatar` is modified, I verified that `Avatar` is working as expected in all cases)
- [x] If the PR modifies a component related to any of the existing Storybook stories, I tested and verified all stories for that component are still working as expected.
- [x] If the PR modifies a component or page that can be accessed by a direct deeplink, I verified that the code functions as expected when the deeplink is used - from a logged in and logged out account.
- [x] If the PR modifies the UI (e.g. new buttons, new UI components, changing the padding/spacing/sizing, moving components, etc) or modifies the form input styles:
    - [x] I verified that all the inputs inside a form are aligned with each other.
    - [x] I added `Design` label and/or tagged `@Expensify/design` so the design team can review the changes.
- [x] If a new page is added, I verified it's using the `ScrollView` component to make it scrollable when more elements are added to the page.
- [x] If the `main` branch was merged into this PR after a review, I tested again and verified the outcome was still expected according to the `Test` steps.

18269663,PullRequestEvent,"https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/41794

we can now use `p expr` and `p(expr)`:

```
Break on start in test.js:1
> 1 const a = 1;
  2 console.log(a);
debug> n
break in test.js:2
  1 const a = 1;
> 2 console.log(a);
debug> p a
1
debug> p('a')
1
debug> 
```

if this is ok, i will add test and change docs.

Currently, users need to go the insights tab and individually add insights to their dashboards. In the current version of dashboards, there is only support to create a new insight and not add an existing one. This PR aims to offer a modal similar to the one found in the insight page so users can both add existing insights or create new insights to their dashboards from their dashboards.

Closes #19710

"
69588470,PullRequestEvent,"This is the first step towards fixing the distinct ID reuse problem as described in [#20187](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/20187).

This only contains the schema migration to make the field nullable, and `SELECT` query changes that needed to be made to accommodate the potential for `NULL` values in `posthog_persondistinctid` where they previously were not possible. The [change that replaces deletions with updates that set the person field to `NULL` will happen separately](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/20226).

### Query Updates

The biggest risk here is that I overlooked some read queries that require updates. I am pretty confident in my ability to find plaintext SQL queries that reference `posthog_persondistinctid` but only somewhat confident in my ability to exhaustively uncover all of the Django ORM queries.

All of the plaintext `SELECT` queries in plugin-server are qualified by team, but there were a couple in the Django application that needed updating.

For ORM queries, this is what I looked for:

1. `PersonDistinctId` model references that were used to build querysets that did not include a reference to `person`: something like `PersonDistinctId.objects.filter(team=team, person__in=…)` is fine, but `PersonDistinctId.objects.filter(team=team)` is not.
2. `persondistinctid_set` references on model instances or part of `Prefetch`: similar to above `person.persondistinctid_set` would be fine, but `team.persondistinctid_set` would not be."
69588470,PullRequestEvent,Reverts PostHog/posthog#20590
69588470,PullRequestEvent,"## Problem

Given the filters:
```
[
 {event: '$pageview', properties: ['type': 'contains', 'value': '/blog']},
 {event: '$pageview', properties: ['type': 'contains', 'value': '/pricing']}
]
```

Using the 'OR' we have today produces a ClickHouse query in the form:
```
WHERE
 ...
AND (
 (event = '$pageview' AND has_properties_0) OR ((event = '$pageview' AND has_properties_1))
)
```

This matches falsely, as it includes results where only one of the two pageview events occurred

## Changes

Propose changing to an `AND` & cleaning up the use of brackets

```
WHERE
 ...
AND (
 (event = '$pageview' AND has_properties_0) AND ((event = '$pageview' AND has_properties_1))
)
```

But that makes it fail in the simple test case, `( event = %(event_matcher_0_event)s  ) AND ( event = %(event_matcher_1_event)s  )` which no longer returns results

Could it possibly be expecting both conditions to be satisfied by the same `event`? e.g. `WHERE ($current_url = '/blog') AND ($current_url = '/pricing')`

Hi Shane. Like the concept and project name etc.
Have reorganized just to get the game running (logs to console so left debug open)
No graphics, but i haven't looked thru the game code yet.
It's running from src so it needs to be changed back to dist. (i'm still learning Electron)
Coded a quick text-ticker and started on a rough icon. (wip)
Hope to contribute more as time allows. Cheers.

43144390,PullRequestEvent,"Hi `pboling/sanitize_email`!

This is a one-off automatically generated pull request from LGTM.com :robot:. You might have heard that we’ve integrated LGTM’s underlying CodeQL analysis engine natively into GitHub. The result is [**GitHub code scanning**](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning)!

With LGTM fully integrated into code scanning, we are focused on improving CodeQL within the native GitHub code scanning experience. In order to take advantage of current and future improvements to our analysis capabilities, we suggest you enable code scanning on your repository. Please take a look at our [blog post for more information](https://github.blog/2022-08-15-the-next-step-for-lgtm-com-github-code-scanning/).

This pull request enables code scanning by adding an auto-generated [`codeql.yml` workflow file for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/setting-up-code-scanning-for-a-repository#setting-up-code-scanning-manually) to your repository — take a look! We tested it before opening this pull request, so all should be working :heavy_check_mark:. In fact, you might already have seen some alerts appear on this pull request!

Where needed and if possible, we’ve adjusted the configuration to the needs of your particular repository. But of course, you should feel free to tweak it further! Check [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#editing-a-code-scanning-workflow) for detailed documentation.

Questions? Check out the FAQ below!

### FAQ
<details>
<summary>Click here to expand the FAQ section</summary>

#### How often will the code scanning analysis run?
By default, code scanning will trigger a scan with the CodeQL engine on the following events:
* On every pull request — to flag up potential security problems for you to investigate before merging a PR.
* On every push to your default branch and other protected branches — this keeps the analysis results on your repository’s *Security* tab up to date.
* Once a week at a fixed time — to make sure you benefit from the latest updated security analysis even when no code was committed or PRs were opened.

#### What will this cost?
Nothing! The CodeQL engine will run inside GitHub Actions, making use of your [unlimited free compute minutes for public repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#about-billing-for-github-actions).

#### What types of problems does CodeQL find?
The CodeQL engine that powers GitHub code scanning is the exact same engine that powers LGTM.com. The exact set of rules has been tweaked slightly, but you should see almost exactly the same types of alerts as you were used to on LGTM.com: we’ve enabled the [`security-and-quality` query suite](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#using-queries-in-ql-packs) for you.

#### How do I upgrade my CodeQL engine?
No need! New versions of the CodeQL analysis are constantly deployed on GitHub.com; your repository will automatically benefit from the most recently released version.

#### The analysis doesn’t seem to be working
If you get an error in GitHub Actions that indicates that CodeQL wasn’t able to analyze your code, please [follow the instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/troubleshooting-the-codeql-workflow) to debug the analysis.

#### How do I disable LGTM.com?
If you have LGTM’s automatic pull request analysis enabled, then you can [follow these steps to disable the LGTM pull request analysis](https://lgtm.com/help/lgtm/managing-automated-code-review#disabling-pr-integration). You don’t actually need to remove your repository from LGTM.com; it will automatically be removed in the next few months as part of the deprecation of LGTM.com ([more info here](https://github.blog/2022-08-15-the-next-step-for-lgtm-com-github-code-scanning/)).

#### Which source code hosting platforms does code scanning support?
GitHub code scanning is deeply integrated within GitHub itself. If you’d like to scan source code that is hosted elsewhere, we suggest that you create a mirror of that code on GitHub.

#### How do I know this PR is legitimate?
This PR is filed by the official LGTM.com GitHub App, in line with the [deprecation timeline that was announced on the official GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2022-08-15-the-next-step-for-lgtm-com-github-code-scanning/). The proposed GitHub Action workflow uses the [official open source GitHub CodeQL Action](https://github.com/github/codeql-action/). If you have any other questions or concerns, please join the discussion [here](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/29534) in the official GitHub community!

#### I have another question / how do I get in touch?
Please join the discussion [here](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/29534) to ask further questions and send us suggestions!

Changelog:
```
with experimental support for non-aggregated metering reporting
- [Daml Standard Library] An argument order in the default
  implementation of ``Foldable.foldl1`` was reversed from that of
  ``DA.List.foldl1``; this incompatibly changes the former to match the
  latter.

- [HTTP-JSON] Added documentation for the new user management endpoints


- [HTTP-JSON] Adjusted the response for the createUser & deleteUser endpoint to an empty object instead of ""true"". This was done to allow possible future extensions to the return type without applying breaking changes.
- [HTTP-JSON] Made the field rights optional for the request body of the createUser endpoint. Now it is possible to create a user with just the userId (i.e. { ""userId"": ""nice.user"" }).

- [Integration Kit] - ledger-api-bench-tool allow to define ledger-begin and ledger-end offset boundaries for streams.
Ledger API Specification: When using user management based authorization streams will now get aborted on authenticated user's rights change.
- [Daml Standard Library] The DA.Generics module has been removed.
Ledger API Specification: Maximum number of user rights per user is now limited to 1000 and is added to UserManagementFeature in VersionService. getLedgerApiVersion endpoint.
[daml-react] A `useUser` react hook is added to the daml-react
TypeScript library. It allows for easy access to the currently logged in
user of a ledger participant node for ledgers supporting user
management.

53831230,PullRequestEvent,"This adds a simple macro to the `move-unit-test` crate to allow Rust crates to add Move unit tests to its tests in a similar manner to `datatest_stable::harness`. This way Move unit tests will be run in CI.

I've  used this new feature in the `move-stdlib` crate as an example of how this would look (and since there is already Move code in there using unit tests that we want checked in CI).

Note that the features exposed through `cargo test` are fairly basic (no filtering etc.). If a user wants to run the Move unit tests and pass filters, num_threads, etc. they will need to use the move-unit-test binary itself (and later on the move cli).

## Motivation

*DiemAccount.move*
`fun epilogue_common<Token>`
```
// The transaction sequence number is passed in to prevent any
// possibility of the account's sequence number increasing by more than
// one for any transaction.
sender_account.sequence_number = sender_account.sequence_number + 1;
```
This sequence number increasing behavior is not specified in spec function.

*DualAttestation.move*
spec for the following code is missing

```
move_to(
    dr_account,
    Limit {
        micro_xdx_limit: (initial_limit as u64)

Diem Core Framework (DCF) developers work on .move files that are included in the genesis. This is a significantly different workflow to regular Move application developers in that
1. DCF devs are using the root mint.key to seed the genesis txn w move modules
2. This implies special privileges
3. DCF devs cannot be the default sender address of 0x241... on genesis writes

Adding the below flag will allow one to customize the genesis on creation of a new node:

To streamline font management this PR moves the sample project fonts to the top level of `assets/font`. This matches the functionality of the Create Theme Block.

This PR moves the sample project fonts to `assets/fonts/` instead of storing the fonts in their own directories inside of `assets/fonts `assets/fonts/din-pro/`. The theme.json file is updated with the new file path.

- Database tables/models must strictly adhere to match Ghost CMS' predefined tables.

The version **0.58.0** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

If you don’t accept this pull request, your project will work just like it did before. However, you might be missing out on a bunch of new features, fixes and/or performance improvements from the dependency update.

It might be worth looking into these changes and trying to get this project onto the latest version of flow-bin.

If you have a solid test suite and good coverage, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes directly by merging the proposed change into your project. If the build fails or you don’t have such unconditional trust in your tests, this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

#### Description
<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->
  * Adds stubs generator script for CI

Currently, this will only open a new PR for stubs if and only if there are changes anywhere in the `QuantConnect.Algorithm` namespace.

Note: this will require setting up a new account that pushes directly to a dedicated branch in this repo. This will also require setting up the following env vars in Travis @jaredbroad - the username and API key should be an account that will open PRs to Lean

  * `GH_API_KEY`: GitHub API key (aka personal access key) (SECRET)
  * `GH_USERNAME`: GitHub username
  * `GH_BASE_BRANCH`: Branch to open PR for (PR will merge into this branch)
  * `GH_REPO_ID`: Base64 encoded string pointing to repo. It has to be sourced from the GH API - I can get this one for you 👍 

The script is currently setup to push to the `feature-python-autogenerated-stubs` branch in this repo.
If we want to automatically open a PR to add Python stubs to Lean after this is merged, we will need to get Travis setup before merging. The CI script will only run when merging to the master branch, we shouldn't get stuck in an infinite loop of stubs generation

### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>mockito/mockito</summary>

### [`v5.0.0`](https://togithub.com/mockito/mockito/releases/tag/v5.0.0)

### Mockito 5: prepare for future JDK versions

For a while now, we have seen an increase in problems/incompatibilities with recent versions of the JDK due to our usage of JVM-internal API.
Most notably, JDK 17 made some changes which are incompatible with the current subclass mockmaker.
Therefore, to prepare for the future of JDK, we are making some core changes to ensure Mockito keeps on working.

#### Switch the default mockmaker to `mockito-inline`

Back in Mockito 2.7.6, we published a new mockmaker based on the ""inline bytecode"" principle.
This mockmaker creates mocks manipulating bytecode equivalent within the original class such that its method implementations hook into the normal Mockito machinery.
As a comparison, the subclass mockmaker generates ""real"" subclasses for mocks, to mimic the same behavior.
While the approaches are similar, the inline mockmaker avoids certain restrictions that the JDK imposes.
For example, it does not violate module boundaries (introduced in JDK 9, but more heavily used in JDK 17) and avoids the leaking of the creation of the subclass.

Note: this does not affect `mockito-android` nor testing on Android.

##### When should I still be using the subclass mockmaker?

There are legitimate remaining use cases for the subclass mockmaker.
For example, on the Graal VM's native image, the inline mockmaker will not work and the subclass mockmaker is the appropriate choice.
Additionally, if you would like to avoid mocking final classes, using the subclass mockmaker is a possibibility.
Note however that if you solely want to use the subclass mockmaker to avoid mocking final, you will run into the above mentioned issues on JDK 17+.
We want to leave this choice up to our users, which is why we will keep on supporting the subclass mockmaker.

If you want to use the subclass mockmaker instead, you can use the new `mockito-subclass` artifact (published [on Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.mockito/mockito-subclass) along with all our other artifacts).

#### Update the minimum supported Java version to 11

Mockito 4 supports Java 8 and above.
Similar to other open source projects, we are moving away from JDK 8 and to newer versions.
The primary reason for moving away from JDK 8 is the increasing maintenance costs with keeping our own infrastructure working.
Lately we have been running into more and more JDK 8 breakages.
Additionally, while we want to support the newest JDK API's, our current solution to support both JDK 8 and newer versions causes [issues with the `SecurityManager`](https://togithub.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2798).
Since we want Mockito to work on the newest version and more and more businesses adopting JDK 11, we have decided to make the switch as well.

Massive thanks to community member [@&#8203;reta](https://togithub.com/reta) who implemented this change.

##### What should I do if I still run JDK 8?

For JDK 8 and below, you can keep on using Mockito 4.
This is similar to if you are using JDK 6, for which you can keep on using Mockito 2.
The changes in Mockito 5 (for now) are primarily focused on the latest JDK versions, which means the API differences between Mockito 4 and 5 are minimal.
However, over time this will most likely widen, so we do recommend adopting JDK 11 in the future.

#### New `type()` method on `ArgumentMatcher`

One of our most used public API's for customizing Mockito is the [`ArgumentMatcher` interface](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org/mockito/ArgumentMatcher.html).
The interface allows you to define a custom matcher, which you can pass into method arguments to provide more targeted matches.
One major shortcoming of the `ArgumentMatcher` was the lack of varargs support.
There were many, many issues filed related to varargs and Mockito unable to handle them.

Community member [@&#8203;big-andy-coates](https://togithub.com/big-andy-coates) put in a lot of effort to come up with an appropriate solution, including fully implementing and comparing 2 approaches.
Ultimately, we decided that introducing a new `type()` method on `ArgumentMatcher` is the best solution.
As a result, it is now possible to update your custom matchers to implement varargs support, if you so desire.
Note that `ArgumentMatcher` is still a `@FunctionalInterface` and can therefore still be written as a lambda.

##### What is the effect of this new method?

For varargs methods, there was previously a way to only match zero arguments, or two or more arguments, by using the exact number of matchers, i.e.

```java
long call(String... args);

// Will match calls with exactly zero arguments:
when(mock.call()).thenReturn(0L);

// Will match calls with exactly two arguments:
when(mock.call(any(), any())).thenReturn(0L);
```

But following the pattern to match exactly one argument:

```java
when(mock.call(any())).thenReturn(0L);
```

doesn't work, as `any` is ""vararg aware"", so Mockito matched the `any` against *each element* of the varargs parameter, meaning it will match any number of arguments, i.e. the above would of matched all of these:

```java
mock.call();
mock.call(""a"");
mock.call(""a"", ""b"");
```

With the new `type` method, it's now possible to differentiate matching calls with any exact number of arguments, or to match any number of arguments.

```java
// Match any number of arguments:
when(mock.call(any(String[].class))).thenReturn(1L);
// Match invocations with no arguments:
when(mock.call()).thenReturn(1L);
// Match invocations with exactly one argument:
when(mock.call(any())).thenReturn(1L);
// Alternative to match invocations with exactly one argument:
when(mock.call(any(String.class))).thenReturn(1L);
// Match invocations with exactly two arguments:
when(mock.call(any(), any())).thenReturn(1L);
```

Therefore, if you want to match 0 or more arguments, use `any(String[].class)`.
If you want to match an exact number of arguments, use `any(String.class)` (and specify as many `any` matchers as arguments you want to match on).

In a similar fashion, the behavior of `ArgumentCaptor.forClass` has changed as well.
If you want to capture all arguments, use an `ArgumentCaptor` for `String[]`, otherwise `String`:

```java
// Will capture 1 string
@&#8203;Captor private ArgumentCaptor<String> captor;
// Will capture all strings
@&#8203;Captor private ArgumentCaptor<String[]> captor;
```

For more information, see the description and conversation in [pull request 2835](https://togithub.com/mockito/mockito/pull/2835) and [pull request 2807](https://togithub.com/mockito/mockito/pull/2807).

##### Do I need to implement this new method?

No, you don't need to.
Mockito 5 declares a default implementation, returning `Void.type` as the type of an `ArgumentMatcher`.
This essentially means that Mockito will not consider the type when handling varargs.
However, if you do return a specific type, Mockito will consider this when matching arguments.
As a result, this new method is not a source-breaking change, but is a bytecode-breaking change.
All code working on Mockito 4 should work as-is when recompiled with Mockito 5.

After running a debugger over the code, it appears that (in this case) the Path library does not operate the same way on Linux as it does on Windows. (This is a guess.)

This fix removes all calls to the Path library and replaces them with the equivalent `os.path` functions. For example, `Path(mbedignore_path).is_file()` becomes `os.path.isfile(mbedignore_path)`.

I'm submitting the PR to @Copper-Bot 's fork since that is the code I worked on after reading [this post](https://community.platformio.org/t/platformio-builds-mbed-sources-twice-while-debugging/18483/7). Plus I liked the examples. 😃  @KKoovalsky might be interested in the fix, too.

- Users should not need to understand the difference between all s3 related Hadoop FSes (s3, s3a, s3n) when using Alluxio. All they need to know is to specify the S3 bucket using URL like `s3://bucketname/dir`
- Some S3 related properties are `s3a` and some others are `s3`, very confusing to hard to remember.

# PR Summary
""s3a"" is a Hadoop client-side concept to denote a HDFS compatible implementation, whereas when mounting external s3 bucket into Alluxio, it has nothing to do with Hadoop client.  We should support the canonical S3 bucket URL by ""s3://"" 

# Changes include
- Support ""s3://"" in addition to ""s3a://"" in UFS URL
- Improve property names to be ""alluxio.s3.foo"" rather than ""alluxio.s3a.foo"" to be consistent and make ""alluxio.s3a.foo"" the alias.

## Description:
Add a dedicated directory `/data` to put shares inside it. Now /config is solely for configuration items.
Sync directory (the share share) is not created by default anymore. 

## Benefits of this PR and context:
Provide a dedicated place to create share, before that, creating would be only under `/config` which not ideal. 

## How Has This Been Tested?
1. I've installed the container on my server (x86_64) and run it using podman
2. I added the ID of the server to the instance running on my personal computer
3. I created a share ~/Music on my personal computer where all my music tunes are located
4. I added the server to the share
5. directory /data/Music was created on the container, and the synchronization started

## Remaining tasks
- [x] Release ddclient v3.11.0 
- [x] Rebase this pull request once v3.11.0 has been picked up in this repo.

## Description:
This PR adds documentation about the new secret passing mechanism of ddclient to the README.
This feature is available as of prerelease v3.11.0_1 of ddclient.

**Note**: This is marked as draft, the relevant ddclient update has not reached this repo as only a prerelease was made. The relevant release should happen within a few days. (Relevant discussion [here](https://github.com/ddclient/ddclient/issues/552#issuecomment-1763486276))

## Benefits of this PR and context:
The need of a secret passing mechanism has been mentioned before (#44, #68).
I'm guessing that the prior lack of it also led to attempts to bind-mount of the config file (#70).

## How Has This Been Tested?
Local Jenkins run for README.md generation

## Source / References:
The ddclient changelog [here](https://github.com/ddclient/ddclient/blob/d4f9816a6ad86b64caf77af3a15770ca1c1619da/ChangeLog.md#new-features)

The original ddclient pull request for the secret mechanism is [here](https://github.com/ddclient/ddclient/pull/522). This one was rejected due to the recent maintainership transition. It got picked up in the (now merged back) fork [here](https://github.com/rrthomas/ddclient/pull/2).

I did not yet merge the docs update to ddclient.github.io, but the pull request is [here](https://github.com/ddclient/ddclient.github.io/pull/2).

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The <code>ini</code> npm package before version 1.3.6 has a Prototype Pollution vulnerability.</p>
<p>If an attacker submits a malicious INI file to an application that parses it with <code>ini.parse</code>, they will pollute the prototype on the application. This can be exploited further depending on the context.</p>
<h3>Patches</h3>

Also, I moved our SDK examples to these folders: `text-classification`, `image-classification`, `language-modeling`.
Similar to HuggingFace transformers examples: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch

I think, we should refactor our Training Operator examples directory in the future PRs to make it more ML engineers and data scientists friendly.
Regardless if users are using Kubeflow Python SDK or `kubectl` and YAMLs to submit jobs they should be able to find the appropriate AI/ML training use-cases.

From my perspective, for the long-term we should guide our users more towards Python SDK to submit Kubeflow Jobs.

<summary>Release notes</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/psf/black/releases"">black's releases</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>24.3.0</h2>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>This release is a milestone: it fixes Black's first CVE security vulnerability. If you
run Black on untrusted input, or if you habitually put thousands of leading tab
characters in your docstrings, you are strongly encouraged to upgrade immediately to fix
<a href=""https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-21503"">CVE-2024-21503</a>.</p>
<p>This release also fixes a bug in Black's AST safety check that allowed Black to make
incorrect changes to certain f-strings that are valid in Python 3.12 and higher.</p>
<h3>Stable style</h3>
<ul>
<li>Don't move comments along with delimiters, which could cause crashes (<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/psf/black/issues/4248"">#4248</a>)</li>
<li>Strengthen AST safety check to catch more unsafe changes to strings. Previous versions
of Black would incorrectly format the contents of certain unusual f-strings containing
nested strings with the same quote type. Now, Black will crash on such strings until
support for the new f-string syntax is implemented. (<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/psf/black/issues/4270"">#4270</a>)</li>
<li>Fix a bug where line-ranges exceeding the last code line would not work as expected
(<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/psf/black/issues/4273"">#4273</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix catastrophic performance on docstrings that contain large numbers of leading tab
characters. This fixes
<a href=""https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-21503"">CVE-2024-21503</a>.

<h3>Documentation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Note what happens when <code>--check</code> is used with <code>--quiet</code> (<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/psf/black/issues/4236"">#4236</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>24.2.0</h2>
<h3>Stable style</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where comments where mistakenly removed along with redundant parentheses
(<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/psf/black/issues/4218"">#4218</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Preview style</h3>
<ul>
<li>Move the <code>hug_parens_with_braces_and_square_brackets</code> feature to the unstable style
due to an outstanding crash and proposed formatting tweaks (<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/psf/black/issues/4198"">#4198</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where base expressions caused inconsistent formatting of ** in tenary
expression (<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/psf/black/issues/4154"">#4154</a>)</li>
<li>Checking for newline before adding one on docstring that is almost at the line limit
(<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/psf/black/issues/4185"">#4185</a>)</li>

Currently, we say that [Training Operator SDK is supported in Python 3 and 3.7](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/blob/master/sdk/python/setup.py#L45-L47).
Also, it's better to be compatible with other Kubeflow components SDKs, [e.g. with Kubeflow Pipelines](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/blob/master/sdk/python/setup.py#L85-L87).

We can think about Python upgrade in the future releases/versions across various Kubeflow components.

#### Note for [zero-installs](https://yarnpkg.com/features/zero-installs) users

If you are using the Yarn feature [zero-installs](https://yarnpkg.com/features/zero-installs) that was introduced in Yarn V2, note that this PR does not update the `.yarn/cache/` directory meaning this code cannot be pulled and immediately developed on as one would expect for a zero-install project - you will need to run `yarn` to update the contents of the `./yarn/cache` directory. 
If you are not using zero-install you can ignore this as your flow should likely be unchanged.

62039782,PullRequestEvent,"### TLDR
I try to solve #36951 in the way like ""set fileencodings= xxx,xxx"" in vim.

--------------------------

#### How to use :
If we want to try to open a file in the order of ""utf-8"", ""big5"", ""...(some codepages you want)"".
In the setting.json, just add - 
```
file.encoding_candidate: [ ""utf-8"", ""big5"", ""....(some codepages you want)""]
```
Then the editor will try to open file with ""utf-8"", if it failed, try ""big5"", and so on.


#### Note :
I use ""TextDecoder"" to check if the file can be opened.
Thus please check that the encoding you want to use exists in ""TextDecoder"" before use.

#### Priority:
auto detected encoding <  file.encoding_candidate

-------------------------
For #36951.

There are a few changes in behaviour, but they seem minor:

- if post_load fails, subsequent attempts to load the module will ""succeed""
- since we didn't remove/reload the module, a failure because of an incorrect post_load wasn't fixable, however it was possible to update the manifest

Still seems like a wonky state to be in, and one we should ignore.

Also remove the logging of the error: since we're re-raising as-is, the parent logs it with a traceback, so this is unnecessary and redundant.

get_instructions, and inlining the usage of that is as readable as
calling _get_opcodes.

Also use the subset/superset predicate for validity testing instead of
difference as it's a fair bit faster:

    ❯ python3.8 -mtimeit -s 's1 = set(range(10)); s2 = set(range(5))' 's2 - s1'
    5000000 loops, best of 5: 88.3 nsec per loop

we're paying double in the failure case but that doesn't super duper matter
because we're raising an exception and bailing out, the 24% gain on the
happy path seems more relevant.

34910018,PullRequestEvent,"1. Fixing a bug where calling predict() on the empty model that hasn't been loaded results in the infinite loop execution.
2. More careful error-handling: NHelper::Check... checks were only scheduling the exception without interrupting the flow of execution, which in turn could cause UB. Handling the result of the checks and returning early. Why C-like (or go-like?) error handling instead of using some custom exception? Node package has to be built on each host that would like to install it, so every client should have a compiler version capable of compiling the bindings. Catboost exceptions make use of C++17 features and not work well with some common compilers (like GCC), so it is much safer to add a couple of if statements."

4368172,PullRequestEvent,"Running `servo-tidy` in a virtualenv where all you've done is `pip install servo-tidy==0.3.0` doesn't actually work because of missing dependencies. PyYAML and voluptuous are required as well. I don't know anything about python package management but declaring these missing dependencies seems like an appropriate thing to do. Patch itself is untested because I don't know how, although with these dependencies installed in my virtualenv running `servo-tidy` works.

61849395,PullRequestEvent,"##### SUMMARY
The Terraform module currently has a `variables:` parameter that iterates an Ansible dictionary and passes each variable as a command line argument to the terraform command. However, because Terraform requires all variables to be declared in a `variable ""name"" {}` block within one of the Terraform code files, the names of all variables must be repeated in the code files or in a separate `variables.tf`. Nothing other than the name of the variable is needed--specifying the type, description, or default value is optional. 

For use cases where the Terraform project is only ever run via Ansible, this creates a lot of repetition. This PR proposes a new feature where the module would automatically generate a `variables.tf` file containing the names of all keys in the `variables:` dictionary parameter. This new feature is disabled by default (this is also necessary because enabling it before deleting the existing declarations would cause an error) and enabled by the use of a new `declare_variables:` boolean.

Actually generating a file seems a bit clunky to me, but there doesn't seem to be any other way to do this as variables cannot be declared via command line arguments. Feel free to let me know if you can think of a better way to do this.

61849395,PullRequestEvent,"##### SUMMARY
Some options of this module are `dict` of `str` which are sent verbatim to the PVE API. Unfortunately, if the user makes a mistake in those strings, the API will error out with:
```
400 Bad Request: Parameter verification failed.
```
which isn't very informative about where the error occured. This PR offers to tackle this problem by converting these `dict` of `str` into `lists` of `dict` and provide adequate documentation for each of the suboptions. This will also provide better clarity and readability to users while hopefully not having too big an impact on maintaining the module.

**THIS PR INTRODUCES BREAKING CHANGES**

Here is a proposed todo list which can evolve as this PR is written:

- [x] Create storage (`ide, sata, scsi, virtio`) arg_specs

- [x] Create stub documentation for storage options

- [x] Write adequate documentation for storage suboptions using the [Proxmox VE Administration Guide](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/pve-admin-guide.html) and the [Proxmox VE API documentation](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/api-viewer/index.html#/nodes/{node}/qemu/{vmid}/config)

- [ ] Modify examples to comply with new storage definition

- [x] Add logic to flatten `storage` lists of `dict` into `str` that are understood by the API

- [x] Add logic to populate new lists of `dict` from old `dict` of `str` for `storage` options 

- [ ] Create `hostpci` arg_specs

- [ ] Create stub documentation for `hostpci` options

- [ ] Write adequate documentation for `hostpci` suboptions using the [Proxmox VE Administration Guide](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/pve-admin-guide.html) and the [Proxmox VE API documentation](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/api-viewer/index.html#/nodes/{node}/qemu/{vmid}/config)

- [ ] Add logic to flatten `hostpci` lists of `dict` into `str` that are understood by the API

- [ ] Modify examples to comply with new `hostpci` option definition

- [ ] Create `net` arg_specs

- [ ] Create stub documentation for `net` options

- [ ] Write adequate documentation for net suboptions using the [Proxmox VE Administration Guide](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/pve-admin-guide.html) and the [Proxmox VE API documentation](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/api-viewer/index.html#/nodes/{node}/qemu/{vmid}/config)

##### ISSUE TYPE
- Feature Pull Request

##### COMPONENT NAME
proxmox_kvm.py

##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
As outlined in PR #4106 a `dict` instead of a `str` for API options offers better readability and clarity for the user, while not adding too big an overhead for the maintainer. This also simplifies error catching, as the API error message doesn't indicate where the error occured. This approach would help catching some of those errors before even sending them through the API, and offering clearer error messages to the user.

For now, I've renamed the corresponding options, and left an alias for the old option, as this PR would introduce breaking changes. I thought this could be added in 5.0.0 or perhaps in 6.0.0 so that it would leave enough time for users to get to know the new syntax.

I welcome any comment you may have to improve this PR."

Small bugfixes:
  - module_utils/lxd.py:

- lxd inventory
- maybe all lxd plugins using module_utils/lxd.py

##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
The inventory plugin could not add the cerifikate to the truststore. If the user had done this via the cli, the plugin could build an inventory via https, otherwise only the locale socket worked.

The behavior of the Python3.10 SSL library was changed so that a change was necessary for self-signed certificates.

##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Reroll of https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/58840

The current module register runners on global scope (in particular, trying to fetch instance-wide listing of runners) what GitLab.com obviously forbids.
But runners can be registered by-project (and by-group although GitLab API does not support it yet).
By opting for project-scope, then listing and idempotent registration are allowed.
Using a (existing) project is also a convenient way to register a group runner (by providing a group registration token). This avoid the failure of requesting instance-wide runners at GitLab.com

This PR also set debug when using extra-verbose options which is quite handy, especially for such a new module.

This would make the [ipa_hbacrule.py](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/blob/29790df583ff5b7c6d0487bde57e27e37e9c423f/plugins/modules/ipa_hbacrule.py#L267) mistakenly treat there was difference and unnecessarily update the hbacrule.

##### ISSUE TYPE

"
61849395,PullRequestEvent,"When modifying existing connections without type, no changes are made.
So require type when state is present.

##### SUMMARY
Set type as required when state=present allows deletion of connections without type.
The stronger version would be to set type as required in the argument spec.

When type is missing, all ip options are ignored for an existing connection, so a complaint is needed IMHO.

Fixes #2858 

##### ISSUE TYPE
- Bugfix Pull Request

##### COMPONENT NAME
nmcli

##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
In plugins/modules/net_tools/nmcli.py#L768 there is a call of `self.ip_conn_type` which is True when type has a supported value.
This evaluates to False when type is not given and results in ignoring all given connection options.

## Summary

Rubocop 1.13 was released today (2021-04-20) and it has dropped support
for Ruby 2.4[1][2].  This causes rubocop to die on the spot when
trying to run it:

    $ bundle exec rubocop --version
    1.13.0
    $ bundle exec rubocop
    Error: RuboCop found unsupported Ruby version 2.4 in `TargetRubyVersion` parameter (in .rubocop.yml). 2.4-compatible analysis was dropped after version 1.12.
    Supported versions: 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3.0

And thus the ""style_check"" ci job is currently broken[3].

Rubocop 1.10 and 1.11 don't work either because of a rename:

    $ bundle exec rubocop
    Error: unrecognized cop Style/StringChars found in .rubocop.yml
    Did you mean `Style/StringMethods`?

The latter and arguably the former are breaking changes on minor
versions, which means that rubocop does not follow semantic
versioning[4][5].  Additionally, the gem was already pinned on a minor
version on commit fe64d9841 (""style: add rubocop 1.9 cops (#8567)""), but
commit c9c9dc7da (""chore(deps): rubocop 1.10"") pinned it only on the
major version (see also issue #8583)[6].  This back-and-forth happened
more than once:

```plaintext
* 2016-10-18: nil         to ""~> 0.44.1"" on commit cc1972848 (""Restrict Rubocop version"")
* 2017-01-14: ""~> 0.44.1"" to ""~> 0.46""   on commit 44324828b (""bump Rubocop to latest version"")
* 2017-03-28: ""~> 0.47""   to ""~> 0.47.1"" on commit 86703f100 (""Use Rubocop v0.47.1 till we're ready for v0.48"")
* 2020-10-21: ""~> 0.93.0"" to ""~> 1.0""    on commit 1ae2a1dd0 (""Bump RuboCop to v1.x"")
* 2021-01-31: ""~> 1.0""    to ""~> 1.8.1""  on commit d460fae31 (""Pin rubocop version (#8564)"")
* 2021-02-19: ""~> 1.9.1""  to ""~> 1.10""   on commit c9c9dc7da (""chore(deps): rubocop 1.10"")
```

The above can be checked with one of the following commands:

    $ tig '-G""rubocop""' -- Gemfile
    # or
    $ git log -p '-G""rubocop""' -- Gemfile

So pin rubocop back on a minor version: the 1.12 series.

### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>nodejs/node</summary>

### [`v14.17.0`](https://togithub.com/nodejs/node/releases/v14.17.0)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/nodejs/node/compare/v14.16.1...v14.17.0)

##### Notable Changes

##### Diagnostics channel (experimental module)

`diagnostics_channel` is a new experimental module that provides an API to create named channels to report arbitrary message data for diagnostics purposes.

The module was initially introduced in Node.js v15.1.0 and is backported to v14.17.0
to enable testing it at a larger scale.

With `diagnostics_channel`, Node.js core and module authors can publish contextual data about what they are doing at a given time. This could be the hostname and query string of a mysql query, for example. Just create a named channel with `dc.channel(name)` and call `channel.publish(data)` to send the data to any listeners to that channel.

```js
const dc = require('diagnostics_channel');
const channel = dc.channel('mysql.query');

MySQL.prototype.query = function query(queryString, values, callback) {
  // Broadcast query information whenever a query is made
  channel.publish({
    query: queryString,
    host: this.hostname,
  });

  this.doQuery(queryString, values, callback);
};
```

Channels are like one big global event emitter but are split into separate objects to ensure they get the best performance. If nothing is listening to the channel, the publishing overhead should be as close to zero as possible. Consuming channel data is as easy as using `channel.subscribe(listener)` to run a function whenever a message is published to that channel.

```js
const dc = require('diagnostics_channel');
const channel = dc.channel('mysql.query');

channel.subscribe(({ query, host }) => {
  console.log(`mysql query to ${host}: ${query}`);
});
```

The data captured can be used to provide context for what an app is doing at a given time. This can be used for things like augmenting tracing data, tracking network and filesystem activity, logging queries, and many other things. It's also a very useful data source for diagnostics tools to provide a clearer picture of exactly what the application is doing at a given point in the data they are presenting.

##### UUID support in the crypto module

The new `crypto.randomUUID()` method now allows to generate random
[RFC 4122](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) Version 4 UUID strings:

```js
const { randomUUID } = require('crypto');

console.log(randomUUID());
// 'aa7c91a1-f8fc-4339-b9db-f93fc7233429'
```

Contributed by James M Snell [#&#8203;36729](https://togithub.com/nodejs/node/pull/36729).

##### Experimental support for `AbortController` and `AbortSignal`

Node.js 14.17.0 adds experimental partial support for `AbortController` and `AbortSignal`.

Both constructors can be enabled globally using the `--experimental-abortcontroller` flag.

Additionally, several Node.js APIs have been updated to support `AbortSignal` for cancellation.
It is not mandatory to use the built-in constructors with them. Any spec-compliant third-party alternatives
should be compatible.

`AbortSignal` support was added to the following methods:

-   `child_process.exec`
-   `child_process.execFile`
-   `child_process.fork`
-   `child_process.spawn`
-   `dgram.createSocket`
-   `events.on`
-   `events.once`
-   `fs.readFile`
-   `fs.watch`
-   `fs.writeFile`
-   `http.request`
-   `https.request`
-   `http2Session.request`
-   The promisified variants of `setImmediate` and `setTimeout`

这个PR基于#30509 ，将cudnn conv算法所需的workspace_size也cache起来。因为cuda11、cudnn8时，发现GetWorkspaceSize占了很多的时间。

#### 1. 目的
解决CUDA11、cuDNN8的性能下降问题。

#### 2. 一些develop的测试数据
以静态图ResNet50 FP32训练为例展开。ResNet50的一些性能数据如下：
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12538138/104873815-574eaf00-598c-11eb-9f02-ccfbbfc4a00c.png)

#### 3. profiling数据
- bs=32时，CUDA10.1上的profiling数据如下：
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12538138/104873862-764d4100-598c-11eb-95ee-d20d73cefa7e.png)

- bs=32时，CUDA11.0上
    - profiling数据一：

    - profiling数据二：
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12538138/104873911-9250e280-598c-11eb-843b-eaec087091ed.png)

#### 4. 分析
- CUDA11.0相比CUDA10.1，GPU时间相同，CPU时间大量增加，主要来源于选择cudnn算法（cudnnGetConvolutionXxxAlgorithm_v7）、获取工作空间大小（cudnnGetConvolutionXxxWorkspaceSize）这2个函数。
- bs较小时（比如bs=32），GPU端计算量较小，CPU开销远远大于GPU时间，成为模型性能的瓶颈，从而导致训练速度显著下降。
- bs较大时（比如bs=128），CPU开销同样增加，但因为GPU端计算量大，GPU时间足以掩盖CPU时间，因此性能得以保持不变。

#### 5. 修复方法
- 方案：在关闭exhaustive_search时，也将找到的cudnn算法、相应的workspace_size保存在cache里，避免反复地调用接口。
- 风险：
    - 访问cache时有加锁，暂不确定是否会引起多线程环境下的资源竞争问题
    - 可能无法完全解决变长数据模型的性能问题
    - 对于cache的大小，是否需要采取一些控制措施
- 效果：
    - 静态图ResNet50 FP32 bs=32训练：关闭exhausttive_search时，CUDA11下训练ips可打平CUDA10.1，但conv2d(_grad)的CPU时间依然略大于CUDA10.0下，怀疑cudnnConvolutionForward调用的CPU时间问题，暂无好的解决方法。

39886733,PullRequestEvent,"This addresses https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/12754.

These changes enable node operators to address the silent dropping (by network middle boxes) of long-lived low-activity ZMQ TCP connections via further operating system level TCP keepalive configuration. For example, ZMQ sockets that publish block hashes can be affected in this way due to the length of time it sometimes takes between finding blocks (e.g.- sometimes more than an hour).

Prior to this patch, operating system level TCP keepalive configurations would not take effect since the SO_KEEPALIVE option was not enabled on the underlying socket.

There are additional ZMQ socket options related to TCP keepalive that can be set. However, I decided not to implement those options in this changeset because doing so would require adding additional bitcoin node configuration options, and would not yield a better outcome. I preferred a small, easily reviewable patch that doesn't add a bunch of new config options, with the tradeoff that the fine tuning would have to be done via well-documented operating system specific configurations.

I tested this patch by running a node with:
`./src/qt/bitcoin-qt -regtest -txindex -datadir=/tmp/node -zmqpubhashblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:28332 &`
and connecting to it with:
`python3 ./contrib/zmq/zmq_sub.py`

Without these changes, `ss -panto | grep 28332 | grep ESTAB | grep bitcoin` will report no keepalive timer information. With these changes, the output from the prior command will show keepalive timer information consistent with the configuration at the time of connection establishment, e.g.-: `timer:(keepalive,119min,0)`.

I also tested with a non-TCP transport and did not witness any adverse effects:
`./src/qt/bitcoin-qt -regtest -txindex -datadir=/tmp/node -zmqpubhashblock=ipc:///tmp/bitcoin.block &`

##### SUMMARY
While searching the module documents I encountered a module ipa_host which seems to mistakenly 'searched and replaced' all instances of 'ipa_host:' to 'community.general.ipa_host:'. This module have a parameter named 'ipa_host' which uses in the document and have replaced with 'community.general.ipa_host', thus making the examples use incorrect parameter.

For each package check membership in the list instead of checking each
package individually using pacman to see if it is a pacman group.

##### SUMMARY
When using a large amount packages the pacman module takes very long to generate the final list of packages, because it checks each pkg individually for group membership via `pacman --sync --groups --quiet pkgname`.

##### ISSUE TYPE

- Bugfix Pull Request

##### COMPONENT NAME
pacman

##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
This improves package installation by 50% on my system (when all packages are already installed).

Solution to loss of (bg)color for nested captions via simpler CSS (`.less` file) update:

- unchanged application of the latter (NOT for `shaka-text-wrapper` classed spans)
- change of application of the colors to be NOT for `shaka-text-wrapper` classed spans OR descendents of `shaka-text-wrapper` classed spans.

Container extensions inheriting from `Symfony\Bridge\Doctrine\DependencyInjection\AbstractDoctrineExtension` (i.e. the extensions in all Doctrine bundles) currently cannot smoothly support the newer bundle directory structure because the existing API relies on information being gleaned from Reflection for the bundle class.  This PR is an attempt to allow these extensions to support the newer structure.  The notable changes here are:

- The `loadMappingInformation()` method will start using the info from the `kernel.bundles_metadata` container parameter which holds the relevant bits of information about the bundle (its namespace and its root path, which can be different from the bundle classpath)
- The `getMappingDriverBundleConfigDefaults()` method is deprecated in favor of `getBundleMappingDriverDefaultConfig()`, this is needed to replace the `\ReflectionClass $bundle` argument with the preferred `array $bundleMetadata`
- The abstract `getMappingResourceConfigDirectory()` method adds a `string $bundleDir` argument, this is needed for the concrete implementations to have conditional paths supporting both structures (similar to other checks in the framework like the `is_dir($bundleDir.'/Resources/views') ? $bundleDir.'/Resources/views' : $bundleDir.'/templates'` check for the templates path)

### TODO

- [ ] Change the call to the deprecated `getMappingDriverBundleConfigDefaults()` method to the newer `getBundleMappingDriverDefaultConfig()` method"

75433959,PullRequestEvent,"When ""reconciling"" ClusterRoleBindings, if a CRB of the expected name but unexpected content exists, it means some other entity (deleted and) created it. Since CRBs can't be updated, we need to delete and recreate it to get back to our version of sanity. However, since deletion is asynchronous, an immediate create will usually/often fail, as noted in the [referenced BZ](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1913398).

With this commit:
1. We make the code more idempotent by only issuing the Delete, allowing a subsequent reconcile to do the Create via the same code path taken during initial bootstrap.
2. As this code path indicates a potential security problem, we make sure an appropriate error appears in the logs.

It would be disastrous to confuse this utility with a bit cast. A bit cast always produces an Unowned value which must immediately be copied to be used. This utility always forwards ownership. It cannot be used to truncate values.

Also, be careful not to convert ""reinterpret cast"" (e.g. Builtin.reinterpretCast) into a ""value cast"" since ownership will be incorrect and the reinterpreted types might not have equivalent layout.

16837285,PullRequestEvent,"Consider this case:
Template A has 2 variants: KIT and NOKIT
KIT has a total cost of 100, NOKIT costs 50

When selling NOKIT, the current code will select the bom of KIT
to calculate the price_unit of NOKIT, which means that when
reconciling the aml of the invoice (amount = 100) with the aml of
the cogs move (amount = 50), it will be partial due to the difference
in amount. This also messes with the balance sheet report.

In addition, we have to mark the invoice as 'BienInversion' to SII, like @jco-odoo said here https://github.com/OCA/l10n-spain/issues/1793, but it will be the next PR.

Please @pedrobaeza @acysos @rafaelbn @HaraldPanten @AlbertCabedo  etc. check this

Paste AEAT answer about this question:
En cuanto al Modelo 303, una factura recibida correspondiente a un bien de inversión debe con Inversión del Sujeto Pasivo debe declararse tanto en las casillas 12 y 13 del IVA devengado como en las casillas 30 y 31 del IVA deducible (siempre que la adquisición o construcción, en su caso, de dicho bien de inversión se encuentre afecto a la actividad empresarial o profesional y se cumplan el resto de requisitos de deducción de las cuotas de IVA establecidos en los artículos 94 y siguientes de la Ley de IVA).

16837285,PullRequestEvent,"Steps to reproduce:
	- Go into settings > Configure Document Layout
	- Choose layout boxed
	- set a company tagline
	- click ""download PDF Preview""
Issue:
	The styling of the company tagline is not the same on the pdf and
	the preview
Cause:
	Module lxml from etree would not interpret the html the same way as
	the browser. In the browser, we would have a 'p' markup inside of the
	'h4' for the title. Effectively applying the style from the css
	sheet. In the pdf, the lxlm module place the 'p' markup after the
	'h4'. Therefore it would not receive the styling of the 'h4'.
	Reproduction:
```
	>>> from lxml import html
	>>> html.tostring(html.fromstring('<div><h4><p>hi</h4></div>'))
	b'<div><h4></h4><p>hi</p></div>'
```
Solution:
	Add an additional styling in the scss file to include the 'p' that
	would come directly after the 'h4'.

37936606,PullRequestEvent,"# Partial workflow

Remember the [custom workflow](https://github.com/tmetz/github-actions-for-ci/issues/4) we are attempting to create for the team? Here's our status on the list of requirements we defined:

- :white_check_mark: **test against multiple targets** so that we know if our supported operating systems and Node.js versions are working
- :white_check_mark: **dedicated test job** so that we can separate out build from test details
- :white_check_mark: **access to build artifacts** so that we can deploy them to a target environment
- **branch protections** so that the `main` branch can't be deleted or inadvertently broken
- **required reviews** so that any pull requests are double checked by teammates
- **obvious approvals** so we can merge quickly and potentially automate merges and deployments

The last three remaining items don't really belong in a `code, build, and test` pipeline because they have to do with processes that involve humans.

## Step 14: Automate the review process

GitHub Actions can run multiple workflows for different event triggers. Let's create a new approval workflow that'll work together with our Node.js workflow.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add a new workflow file to automate the team's review process

1. Create a [new file](https://github.com/tmetz/github-actions-for-ci/new/team-workflow/?filename=.github/workflows/approval-workflow.yml), `.github/workflows/approval-workflow.yml`, on this branch
1. Enter a name for your workflow in the new file, something like:
    ```yaml
    name: Team awesome's approval workflow
    ```

I'll respond when you commit to this branch.

37936606,PullRequestEvent,"# Azure configuration

GitHub Actions is cloud agnostic, so any cloud will work. We'll show how to deploy to Azure in this course.

### Azure resources

We'll use the following Azure resources in this course:
- A [web app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview) is how we'll be deploying our application to Azure.
- A [resource group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview#resource-groups) is a collection of resources, like web apps and virtual machines (VMs).
- An [App Service plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-hosting-plans) is what runs our web app and manages the billing (our app should run for free).

Through the power of GitHub Actions, we can create, configure, and destroy these resources through our workflow files. 

## Step 5: Spin up, configure, and destroy Azure resources

### :keyboard: Activity: Use your workflow file to configure your cloud resources

1. Edit the `.github/CHANGETHIS/spinup-destroy.yml` file on this branch, or [use this quick link](https://github.com/chambersaj/github-actions-continuous-delivery-azure/edit/azure-configuration/.github/CHANGETHIS/spinup-destroy.yml?). _(We recommend opening the quick link in another tab.)_
1. Rename the file to `.github/workflows/spinup-destroy.yml`
1. Change the value of the `AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME:` to `chambersaj-ttt-app`
1. Commit your changes.

The file should look like this:

```yaml

6422482,PullRequestEvent,"Summary: When picking compaction input files, we sometimes stop picking a file that is fully included in the output key-range due to hitting max_compaction_bytes. Including these input files can potentially reduce WA at the expense of larger compactions. Larger compaction should be fine as files from input level are usually 10X smaller than files from output level. This PR adds a mutable CF option `ignore_max_compaction_bytes_for_input` that is enabled by default. We can remove this option once we are sure it is safe.

Test plan:
- CI, a unit test on max_compaction_bytes fails before turning this flag off.
- Benchmark does not show much difference in WA: `./db_bench --benchmarks=fillrandom,waitforcompaction,stats,levelstats -max_background_jobs=12 -num=2000000000 -target_file_size_base=33554432 --write_buffer_size=33554432`

Please use the following format for linking documentation:

- [Usage]:  

-->
```docs
Idea is to have a new format `--for=conditions`  in addition to the previous `--for=condition`, the new format would only evaluate the `OR` conditions. If user wants to perform an `AND` operation, they can pass in the flag again(De Morgan's Law) as suggested by @apelisse . 
  Here's an example :
  kubectl wait --for=conditions='Available=False||Progressing=False'   --timeout=20s deployments/nginx-app 
  Work to do if this is okay:
  - Add support to parse `--for` flag multiple times
  - Add tests
  
  
```



Here's the discussion on google groups for more context : https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-sig-cli/c/MY2nadrMhrM 

There's a design choice to be made to progress, two choices are:
*  Use `--for` flag multiple times to indicate it's an OR operation and if the user wants the AND functionality, they can use UNIX AND operator 
*  Multiple `--for` would imply an AND operation and the string taken can have the `||` operator  like the example above.

for example, Upgrading kubeadm clusters of 1.20 should use the current branch version( 1.20 in release-1.20), not the latest version( 1.22 for now).

The docs use skew latestVersion, will always upgrade from the latest-1 to latest version. For release 1.20, this will result a doc explaining upgrade from 1.20 to 1.21 now, as the latest version is 1.21 now. However ,this should be upgrading from 1.19 to 1.20.

This PR add currentVersionAddMinor to represent for the branch version, please let me know if there are other ways to do this as I am not an expert for this.

This is a cherry-pick of #29009 as @sftim suggests.

<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/locutusjs/locutus/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md"">locutus's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h1>Changelog</h1>
<p>Our combined changelog and roadmap. It contains todos as well as dones.</p>
<p>Only project-wide changes are mentioned here. For individual function changelogs, please refer to their
respective Git histories.</p>
<p>Locutus does not follow SemVer as we're a work in progress - and even though we try,
we cannot guarantee BC-safety for the hundreds of contributions across the many
languages that Locutus is assimilating.</p>
<p>Instead, we recommend using version pinning, and inspect changes for the few particular functions you rely on
when you upgrade.</p>
<h2>Backlog</h2>
<p>Ideas that will be planned and find their way into a release at one point</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Address the 25 remaining test failures that are currently skipped (find out which ones via <code>npm run test:languages:noskip</code>)</li>
<li>[ ] Compare example test cases for PHP against <code>php -r</code> to make sure they are correctly mimicking the most recent stable behavior</li>
<li>[ ] Have <em>one</em> way of checking pure JS arrays vs PHP arrays (vs: <code>Object.prototype.toString.call(arr1) === '[object Array]'</code>, <code>typeof retObj[p] === 'object'</code>, <code>var asString = Object.prototype.toString.call(mixedVar) var asFunc = _getFuncName(mixedVar.constructor) if (asString === '[object Object]' &amp;&amp; asFunc === 'Object') {</code> )</li>
<li>[ ] Investigate if we can have one helper function for intersecting, and use that in all <code>array_*diff*</code> and <code>array_*sort*</code> functions. Refrain from using <code>labels</code>, which those functions currently still rely on</li>
<li>[ ] Investigate if we can have one helper function for sorting, and use that in all <code>*sort*</code> functions</li>
<li>[ ] Investigate if we can have one helper function to resolve <code>Function/'function'/'Class::function'/[$object, 'function']</code>, and use that in <code>is_callable</code>, <code>array_walk</code>, <code>call_user_func_array</code> etc.</li>
<li>[ ] Parse <code>require</code>s with AST just like Browserify does. Then we can add dependencies back to website</li>
<li>[ ] Port a few more tricky/inter-depending Go functions</li>
<li>[ ] Port a few more tricky/inter-depending Python functions</li>
<li>[ ] Port a few more tricky/inter-depending Ruby functions</li>
<li>[ ] website: Render authors server-side</li>
<li>[ ] website: Fix the search functionality</li>
</ul>
<h2>master</h2>
<p>Released: TBA.
<a href=""https://github.com/locutusjs/locutus/compare/v2.0.11...master"">Diff</a>.</p>

#### PR description:

The idea behind this pull request is to improve the association cuts mechanism by providing better and more flexible
way of handling association cuts - the rules to match the local tracks from the near RP to those from the far RP.

Code changes for association cuts include
* cuts (mean and threshold) can be functions of proton kinematics (x_near and y_near) and xangle.
* cuts can be stored as a standard EventSetup object. Can be saved in the database. Can be associated with arbitrary IOV

The update is fully backward compatible - we expect no changes for Run2 workflows. The new flexibility is only exploited in Run3 configurations.

Once this PR is merged, we plan to upload the cuts into the DB. Eventually, we plan to issue a small follow PR where the cuts are consumed from the DB in the standard reco workflows. 

PR documentation includes:

[1_sroka_pps_association_cuts.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/7153919/1_sroka_pps_association_cuts.pdf)

[2_kaspar_pps_association_cuts.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/7153926/2_kaspar_pps_association_cuts.pdf)


#### PR validation:

The plots below compare results before (blue solid) and after this PR (red dashed):

1. for Run2 data reco: [reco_cmp.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/7153933/reco_cmp.pdf)
* no difference as expected

2. for direct simulation: [dirsim_cmp.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/7153937/dirsim_cmp.pdf)
* no difference for Run2 workflows
* the difference in 2021 row is due to [#35177](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/35177) (which is not included in CMSSW_12_1_0_pre2 used as the baseline)

4170616,PullRequestEvent,"#### PR description:

Tests of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/35326#issuecomment-922244279 pointed out that the GEN(+others) step of the HLT addOnTests use `Pythia8GeneratorFilter` while using multiple threads and therefore also 2 concurrent lumis by default. The generator fragment uses Tauola, so `Pythia8ConcurrentHadronizerFilter` can not be used. Following comments in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/35350#issuecomment-923679715 this PR suggests to change the GEN fragments to those without Tauola so `Pythia8ConcurrentHadronizerFilter`, that supports concurrent lumis, can be used.

Following #33446, I introduce the hadronic shower trigger emulator in the EMTF and uGMT for Run-3. Most of the logic resides in `SectorProcessorShower`, so that we retain maximum flexibility to adjust the algorithms during data taking. Both emulators are standalone and do not interfere with existing emulators. Currently, there are not yet included in any workflow.

#### PR validation:

Ran `runTheMatrix -l limited`. There should be no differences in any workflow.

 at line 33 uses the domain state confirmed, draft, planned, or progress

But the default filter, which is called ""to do"", show those 4 states +
to_close (in mrp/views/mrp_production_views.xml line 309)

Side-Note: Issue also present in 14.0, so starting the bug fix from
here. 12.0 doesn't seem to have a to_close state but the count and
filter domain also do not match

Steps to reproduce in 14.0
 On Runbot, go to Inventory click on the ""# to process"" button on a
 Manufacturing card.
- Choose any MO and create a work order. On this work order, click
""Start"", then ""Done"".
- The MO is now in the ""To Close"" stage.
- Go back to Inventory Overview. The number to process has gone down by
 one.
- Click on the ""# to process"" button, you will see that the ""To Close""
 MO appears in the list but is not counted by the button.
(written by dido)

For 13.0 I haven't been able to find steps to reproduce but the button
has not changed between the two versions

<blockquote>
<h2>TensorFlow 2.4.0</h2>
<h1>Release 2.4.0</h1>
<h2>Major Features and Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>tf.distribute</code> introduces experimental support for asynchronous training of models via the <a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/experimental/ParameterServerStrategy""><code>tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy</code></a> API. Please see the <a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/parameter_server_training"">tutorial</a> to learn more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy""><code>MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy</code></a> is now a stable API and is no longer considered experimental. Some of the major improvements involve handling peer failure and many bug fixes. Please check out the detailed tutorial on <a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/multi_worker_with_keras"">Multi-worker training with Keras</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introduces experimental support for a new module named <a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/experimental/numpy""><code>tf.experimental.numpy</code></a> which is a NumPy-compatible API for writing TF programs. See the <a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/tf_numpy"">detailed guide</a> to learn more. Additional details below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adds Support for
<a href=""https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/"">TensorFloat-32</a> on Ampere based GPUs. TensorFloat-32, or TF32 for short, is a math mode for NVIDIA Ampere based GPUs and is enabled by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A major refactoring of the internals of the Keras Functional API has been completed, that should improve the reliability, stability, and performance of constructing Functional models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keras mixed precision API <a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/mixed_precision?version=nightly""><code>tf.keras.mixed_precision</code></a> is no longer experimental and allows the use of 16-bit floating point formats during training, improving performance by up to 3x on GPUs and 60% on TPUs. Please see below for additional details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TensorFlow Profiler now supports profiling <code>MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy</code> and tracing multiple workers using the <a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler#profiling_apis"">sampling mode API</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TFLite Profiler for Android is available. See the detailed <a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/measurement#trace_tensorflow_lite_internals_in_android"">guide</a> to learn more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TensorFlow pip packages are now built with CUDA11 and cuDNN 8.0.2.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>TF Core:</p>
<ul>
<li>Certain float32 ops run in lower precsion on Ampere based GPUs, including  matmuls and convolutions, due to the use of <a href=""https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/"">TensorFloat-32</a>. Specifically, inputs to such ops are rounded from 23 bits of precision to 10
bits of precision. This is unlikely to cause issues in practice for deep learning models. In some cases, TensorFloat-32 is also used for complex64 ops.
TensorFloat-32 can be disabled by running <code>tf.config.experimental.enable_tensor_float_32_execution(False)</code>.</li>
<li>The byte layout for string tensors across the C-API has been updated to match TF Core/C++; i.e., a contiguous array of <code>tensorflow::tstring</code>/<code>TF_TString</code>s.</li>
<li>C-API functions <code>TF_StringDecode</code>, <code>TF_StringEncode</code>, and <code>TF_StringEncodedSize</code> are no longer relevant and have been removed; see <code>core/platform/ctstring.h</code> for  string access/modification in C.</li>
<li><code>tensorflow.python</code>, <code>tensorflow.core</code> and <code>tensorflow.compiler</code> modules are now hidden. These modules are not part of TensorFlow public API.</li>
<li><code>tf.raw_ops.Max</code> and <code>tf.raw_ops.Min</code> no longer accept inputs of type <code>tf.complex64</code> or <code>tf.complex128</code>, because the behavior of these ops is not well defined for complex types.</li>
<li>XLA:CPU and XLA:GPU devices are no longer registered by default. Use <code>TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_enable_xla_devices</code> if you really need them, but this flag will eventually be removed in subsequent releases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>tf.keras</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>steps_per_execution</code> argument in <code>model.compile()</code> is no longer experimental; if you were passing <code>experimental_steps_per_execution</code>, rename it to <code>steps_per_execution</code> in your code. This argument controls the number of batches to run during each <code>tf.function</code> call when calling <code>model.fit()</code>. Running multiple batches inside a single <code>tf.function</code> call can greatly improve performance on TPUs or small models with a large Python overhead.</li>
<li>A <strong>major refactoring</strong> of the internals of the Keras Functional API may affect code that
is relying on certain internal details:
<ul>
<li>Code that uses <code>isinstance(x, tf.Tensor)</code> instead of <code>tf.is_tensor</code> when checking Keras symbolic inputs/outputs should switch to using <code>tf.is_tensor</code>.</li>
<li>Code that is overly dependent on the exact names attached to symbolic tensors (e.g. assumes there will be &quot;:0&quot; at the end of the inputs, treats names as unique identifiers instead of using <code>tensor.ref()</code>, etc.) may break.</li>
<li>Code that uses full path for <code>get_concrete_function</code> to trace Keras symbolic inputs directly should switch to building matching <code>tf.TensorSpec</code>s directly and tracing the <code>TensorSpec</code> objects.</li>
<li>Code that relies on the exact number and names of the op layers that TensorFlow operations  were converted into may have changed.</li>
<li>Code that uses <code>tf.map_fn</code>/<code>tf.cond</code>/<code>tf.while_loop</code>/control flow as op layers and  happens to work before TF 2.4. These will explicitly be unsupported now. Converting these ops to Functional API op layers was unreliable before TF 2.4, and prone to erroring incomprehensibly  or being silently buggy.</li>
<li>Code that directly asserts on a Keras symbolic value in cases where ops like <code>tf.rank</code> used to  return a static or symbolic value depending on if the input had a fully static shape or not. Now these ops always return symbolic values.</li>
<li>Code already susceptible to leaking tensors outside of graphs becomes slightly more likely to do so now.</li>
<li>Code that tries directly getting gradients with respect to symbolic Keras inputs/outputs. Use <code>GradientTape</code> on the actual Tensors passed to the already-constructed model instead.</li>
<li>Code that requires very tricky shape manipulation via converted op layers in order to work, where the Keras symbolic shape inference proves insufficient.</li>
<li>Code that tries manually walking a <code>tf.keras.Model</code> layer by layer and assumes layers only ever have one positional argument. This assumption doesn't hold       true before TF 2.4 either, but is more likely to cause issues now.</li>
</ul>
</li>

(<a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/experimental/ParameterServerStrategy"">https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/experimental/ParameterServerStrategy</a>)
API. Please see the <a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/parameter_server_training"">tutorial</a>
to learn more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy""><code>MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy</code></a>
is now a stable API and is no longer considered experimental. Some of the
major improvements involve handling peer failure and many bug fixes. Please
check out the detailed tutorial on [Multi-worker training with Keras]
(<a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/multi_worker_with_keras"">https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/multi_worker_with_keras</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introduces experimental support for a new module named [<code>tf.experimental.numpy</code>]
(<a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/experimental/numpy"">https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/experimental/numpy</a>) which is a
NumPy-compatible API for writing TF programs. See the [detailed guide]
(<a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/tf_numpy"">https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/tf_numpy</a>) to learn more. Additional details below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adds Support for
<a href=""https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/"">TensorFloat-32</a>
on Ampere based GPUs. TensorFloat-32, or TF32 for short, is a math mode for
NVIDIA Ampere based GPUs and is enabled by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A major refactoring of the internals of the Keras Functional API has been
completed, that should improve the reliability, stability, and performance of
constructing Functional models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keras mixed precision API [<code>tf.keras.mixed_precision</code>]
(<a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/mixed_precision?version=nightly"">https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/mixed_precision?version=nightly</a>)
is no longer experimental and allows the use of 16-bit floating point formats
during training, improving performance by up to 3x on GPUs and 60% on TPUs.
Please see below for additional details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TensorFlow Profiler now supports profiling <code>MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy</code> and
tracing multiple workers using the [sampling mode API]
(<a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler#profiling_apis"">https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler#profiling_apis</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TFLite Profiler for Android is available. See the detailed [guide]

Issue Number: close #38295

Problem Summary:

This is a pointer leak bug that causes the field type of a column changed after a ""SELECT"" statement is executed.

```
SELECT t0.c1, t0.c2 FROM t0 GROUP BY MOD(t0.c0, DEFAULT(t0.c2));
```

When TiDB evaluates the ""DEFAULT"" expression, the table in infoschema is used:

```
tbl, er.err = er.b.is.TableByName(dbName, name.OrigTblName)
...
col := table.FindCol(tbl.Cols(), colName)
```

Furthermore, the reference to this column's field type is passed to the `Constant` struct:

25405787,PullRequestEvent,
25405787,PullRequestEvent,"This PR refers to issue #16230 (`ossl_cipher_unpadblock` is not constant-time). Before this fix, `ossl_cipher_unpadblock` would unpad (i.e., remove the padding) the final block in non-constant time. This PR proposes a constant-time implementation for the function in question as well as additional minor changes to referencing functions, `EVP_DecryptFinal_ex` and `ossl_cipher_generic_block_final`, such that constant-timedness is preserved. It is worth noting that calls to `ERR_raise` have been removed since raising errors mandates branching on secret values (e.g., whether the padding is good). This is further corroborated by the implementations of SSL and TLS unpadding, namely `ssl3_cbc_remove_padding_and_mac` and `tls1_cbc_remove_padding_and_mac`, both referenced by `ossl_cipher_tlsunpadblock`, where `ERR_raise` is not called."

"
25405787,PullRequestEvent,"**What:**

This patch should allow for easier building of openssl windows libraries like they can be found on:
https://www.npcglib.org/~stathis/blog/precompiled-openssl/

**Why:**

We have currently the situation that we want to use a recent windows lib that is build with Visual Studio 2017. But there are only precompiled libraries that are not up to date or not compiled with Visual Studio 2017. First
I tried to apply the patches provided by _stathis_ (in the link above) to a more recent version but failed. So I came up with this patch that seems to solve our problem but most probably still needs a lot of reviewing and work to get it in the official repository.

I think it is important that people are able to build and use a recent openssl versions on windows that works together with tools like CMake. Of course I could have changed https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/blob/master/Modules/FindOpenSSL.cmake and introduced more places openssl is searched for. I did decide against it because the situation on windows concerning library locations is bad enough.

Please let me know what needs to be changed. Please note that I am a total perl newbie:)"

<h2>Add support to install multiple python versions</h2>
<p>In scope of this release we added support to <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-python/pull/567"">install multiple python versions</a>. For this you can try to use this snippet:</p>
<pre lang=""yaml""><code>    - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: |
            3.8
            3.9
            3.10
</code></pre>
<p>Besides, we changed logic with throwing the error for GHES if cache is unavailable to warn (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-python/pull/566"">actions/setup-python#566</a>).</p>

<!-- Describe The Pull Request. Please be sure every change is documented or this can delay review and even discourage maintainers from merging your PR! -->

This PR fixes several bugs regarding Wizard summon items refunding:

1) Refunding Bottle of Tickles back into the spellbook will now correctly increase buy limit of the Bottle of Tickles instead of increasing Bottle of Blood buy limit.

2) Bottle of Blood now correctly refunds 2 spell points instead of 1, as 2 is its original cost.

3) Apprentice contract now correctly refunds 2 spell points instead of 1, as 2 is its original cost.

Fixes #37163

I will also be re-enabling secborgs.

@KorPhaeron Every argument you have made against this feature is wrong.

Hard counters like flash and borgs and laser pointers and other hard equipment checks are what make this game great. If you have a well balanced game with well balanced features where everything is perfect then you get a formulaic game that feels more like going thru the motions then actually fun. The hard counters and zero warning equipment checks are what keep this game unpredictable and lead to half the memorable and iconic stories in the stories of awesome thread.

Furthermore your inability to manage the admin team or create any sort of consensus doesn't lead to an argument against secborgs. How is it that the old headmin team lead mostly by hbl was able to keep borgs as ai right hands without them becoming security right hands but now they can't? What are we missing, how about we solve that issue rather then address the symptom?

##### Fixed

-   Regression, Part II: `Verify` behavior change using `DefaultValue.Mock` ([@&#8203;DesrosiersC](https://togithub.com/DesrosiersC), [#&#8203;1024](https://togithub.com/moq/moq4/issues/1024))

### [`v4.14.2`](https://togithub.com/moq/moq4/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;4142-2020-06-16)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/moq/moq4/compare/v4.14.1...v4.14.2)

##### Fixed

-   Regression: `Verify` behavior change using `DefaultValue.Mock` ([@&#8203;DesrosiersC](https://togithub.com/DesrosiersC), [#&#8203;1024](https://togithub.com/moq/moq4/issues/1024))

### [`v4.14.1`](https://togithub.com/moq/moq4/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;4141-2020-04-28)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/moq/moq4/compare/v4.14.0...v4.14.1)

##### Added

-   New `SetupSequence` verbs `.PassAsync()` and `.ThrowsAsync(...)` for async methods with `void` return type ([@&#8203;fuzzybair](https://togithub.com/fuzzybair), [#&#8203;993](https://togithub.com/moq/moq4/issues/993))

##### Fixed

-   `StackOverflowException` on `VerifyAll` when mocked method returns mocked object ([@&#8203;hotchkj](https://togithub.com/hotchkj), [#&#8203;1012](https://togithub.com/moq/moq4/issues/1012))

### [`v4.14.0`](https://togithub.com/moq/moq4/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;4140-2020-04-24)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/moq/moq4/compare/v4.13.1...v4.14.0)

##### Added

-   A mock's setups can now be inspected and individually verified via the new `Mock.Setups` collection and `IInvocation.MatchingSetup` property ([@&#8203;stakx](https://togithub.com/stakx), [#&#8203;984](https://togithub.com/moq/moq4/issues/984)-#&#8203;987, [#&#8203;989](https://togithub.com/moq/moq4/issues/989), [#&#8203;995](https://togithub.com/moq/moq4/issues/995), [#&#8203;999](https://togithub.com/moq/moq4/issues/999))

-   Two new public methods in `Times`: `bool Validate(int count)` and `string ToString()` ([@&#8203;stakx](https://togithub.com/stakx), 975)

##### Changed

-   Attempts to mark conditionals setup as verifiable are now considered an error, since conditional setups are ignored during verification. Calls to `.Verifiable()` on conditional setups are no-ops and can be safely removed. ([@&#8203;stakx](https://togithub.com/stakx), [#&#8203;997](https://togithub.com/moq/moq4/issues/997))

-   When matching invocations against setups, captured variables nested inside expression trees are now evaluated. Their values likely matter more than their identities. ([@&#8203;stakx](https://togithub.com/stakx), [#&#8203;1000](https://togithub.com/moq/moq4/issues/1000))

##### Fixed

-   Regression: Restored `Capture.In` use in `mock.Verify(expression, ...)` to extract arguments of previously recorded invocations. ([@&#8203;vgriph](https://togithub.com/vgriph), [#&#8203;968](https://togithub.com/moq/moq4/issues/968); [@&#8203;stakx](https://togithub.com/stakx), [#&#8203;974](https://togithub.com/moq/moq4/issues/974))

-   Consistency: When mocking a class `C` whose constructor invokes one of its virtual members, `Mock.Of<C>()` now operates like `new Mock<C>()`: a record of such invocations is retained in the mock's `Invocations` collection ([@&#8203;stakx](https://togithub.com/stakx), [#&#8203;980](https://togithub.com/moq/moq4/issues/980))

-   After updating Moq from 4.10.1 to 4.11, mocking NHibernate session throws a `System.NullReferenceException` ([@&#8203;ronenfe](https://togithub.com/ronenfe), [#&#8203;955](https://togithub.com/moq/moq4/issues/955))

**Release Summary**

This release contains a number of significant changes, including a transition to Swagger/OpenAPI v3 and support for ASP.NET Core 3.0, and will require modifications to your application setup if you're upgrading from previous major versions.

While it's awesome to finally support the latest **Swagger/OpenAPI version (v3)**, this does introduce significant structural changes to the Swagger object model, which you're likely interacting with to configure and/or extend Swashbuckle. Specific details are provided below but at a high level, the built-in `SwaggerDocument` and contained types have now been replaced with an `OpenApiDocument` object model that's imported from the [Micorosft/OpenAPI.NET](https://togithub.com/Microsoft/OpenAPI.NET) library.

To coincide with the release of **ASP.NET Core 3.x**, this version of Swashbuckle will be fully compatible with that version of the framework, including out-of-the-box support for the new _System.Text.Json (STJ)_ serializer. 

Furthermore, this release also includes a [wide range of bug fixes and enhancements](https://togithub.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore/milestone/7?closed=1) including an upgrade of the embedded **swagger-ui to 3.24.3**, an upgrade of the **ReDoc UI to 2.0.0-rc.14**, improved handling of `IFormFile` and `FileResult` parameters and responses, and support for polymorphic models.

**Breaking Changes**

-   _New Swagger/OpenAPI Object Model:_

Best case, you can simply replace references to the old Swagger objects (`Info`, `Operation`, `Schema` etc.) with corresponding types from the new object model (e.g. `OpenApiInfo`, `OpenApiOperation`, `OpenApiSchema`) available in the `Microsoft.OpenApi.Models` namespace. However, the old model was based on version 2.0 of the Swagger/OpenApi spec. whereas the new version is based on 3.0. Therefore, depending on the extent to which you're manipulating the generated Swagger, you may need to re-work some of your code. Check out the [official Swagger docs](https://swagger.io/blog/news/whats-new-in-openapi-3-0/) to get a better sense of what's changed between v2 and v3 of the spec.

It's also worth noting ... if you have consumers of the generated Swagger JSON that _still_ depend on v2 of the spec, you can configure the Swagger middleware to continue outputting in that format:

    app.UseSwagger(c => c.SerializeAsV2 = true);

-   _Honors System.Text.Json Serializer instead of Newtonsoft by default:_

While previous versions of Swashbuckle honored Newtonsoft settings/attributes by default when generating Swagger, this version honors STJ options/attributes by default. If you're still using the Newtonsoft serializer, then you'll need to install a separate Swashbuckle package and explicitly opt-in as described [here](https://togithub.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore#systemtextjson-stj-vs-newtonsoft)

-   _Changes to Filter Interfaces_ 

As a result of the object model change, the `Apply` method for _all_ filter types accepts a type from the new model instead of the old. For example, `IOperationFilter.Apply` now accepts an `OpenApiOperation`, `IParameterFilter.Apply` an `OpenApiParameter` and so on. 

Also, the `SchemaRegistry` property on filter context objects has been replaced with a `SchemaGenerator/SchemaRepository` pair of properties. This change is the result of an underlying separating of concerns into ""schema generation"" and ""referenced schema storage"". Now, if you need to leverage the schema generator within a filter, it should be invoked as follows:

```csharp
var schema = context.SchemaGenerator.GenerateSchema(typeof(CustomType), context.SchemaRepository);
```

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
[upx](https://github.com/upx/upx) is a tool that can reduce the binary size dramatically.

You can see the reduce ratio below:
```
        File size         Ratio      Format      Name
   --------------------   ------   -----------   -----------
 108234000 ->  41676816   38.51%   macho/amd64   ks-apiserver 


         File size         Ratio      Format      Name

  72386928 ->  28536848   39.42%   macho/amd64   controller-manager
```

Before we using upx, the docker images size is:
```
surenpi/ks-controller-manager   reduce-binary-size                               262ebb9fa9d4       78.5MB

```

After we using upx, the docker images size is:
```
surenpi/ks-controller-manager   reduce-binary-size                               dc649966e3ec       34.7MB

##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

The documentation for [ansible.builtin.user.groups](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/user_module.html#parameter-groups) reads:

> A list of supplementary groups which the user is also a member of.
> By default, the user is removed from all other groups. Configure [append](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/user_module.html#ansible-collections-ansible-builtin-user-module-parameter-append) to modify this.
> When set to an empty string '', the user is removed from all groups except the primary group.
> Before Ansible 2.3, the only input format allowed was a comma separated string.

Below, an example contains the following snippet, which uses the pre-2.3 syntax:
```yaml
- name: Add the user 'james' with a bash shell, appending the group 'admins' and 'developers' to the user's groups
  ansible.builtin.user:
    name: james
    shell: /bin/bash
    groups: admins,developers
    append: yes
```

This pr changes the example to use the new syntax

Currently docker_container module sets `Volumes` field for all volumes passed.  This behavior is inconsistent with `docker run` command.  This commit fixes `docker_container.py` to set `Volumes` field only when anonymous volumes are passed.

This behavior is also clarified in the following comment:

By default, verbose logging from the s3_storage module would be sent to STDOUT. This has proven confusing in some production situations.

This change installs sets the required configuration to direct S3 logs to the DEV channel.

A side-effect of this is that we will need to be sure to ask for unredacted logs if we want to see any meaningful content.

Release note (ops change): Logs produced by setting an increased vmodule setting for s3_storage are now directed to the DEV channel rather than STDOUT.

`findSplitKeyUsingIterator()` incorrectly adjusted `NoSplitSpans`: it was supposed to only consider spans with end keys after the minimum possible split key, but it did not handle the case where _no_ spans matched and instead considered _all_ spans. This is the common case, and incurs a ton of additional key comparisons in the hot path. This patch correctly handles this case.

In Go 1.19, struct comparisons saw a significant performance regression, apparently due to the use of `memeqbody`. This patch changes `EncodeMVCCValue` to use field comparisons instead of struct comparisons, which yields a significant performance gain.

Unfortunately, this prevents mid-stack inlining. However, the struct comparison regression is significantly larger than the inlining gains. We should reconsider this once Go 1.20 lands, where the regression has been fixed.

fixes https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/88172

Measures time row-level TTL job takes to run on a table:
1) Drop TTL table IF EXISTS.
2) Create a table without TTL.
3) Insert initialRowCount number of rows.
4) Gets number of rows that should expire.
5) Wait for table ranges to stabilize after scattering.
6) Enable TTL on table.
7) Poll table until TTL job is complete.
Note: Ops is a no-op and no histograms are used.
Benchmarking is done inside Hooks and details are logged.

Adds useDistSQL field to TTL job progress protobuf for
visibility into which version was run during cluster
upgrades.

Release justification: Added TTL workload.

#### colexecproj: add benchmark for colexecproj.defaultCmpRConstProjOp

Release note: None

#### eval: reduce interface->interface conversions in ComparisonWithSubOperator

Consider the schema and queries below.

    CREATE TABLE a (a STRING);
    INSERT INTO a SELECT 'abc' || i::STRING FROM generate_series(1, 500) g(i);

    CREATE TABLE b (b STRING);
    INSERT INTO b SELECT 'abc' || i::STRING FROM generate_series(1, 75000) g(i);

    CREATE TABLE c (c STRING);

    SELECT * FROM b
    WHERE b IN (SELECT a FROM a) OR
          b IN (SELECT c FROM c);

A significant portion of time is spent performing `tree.Expr` to
`tree.Datum` conversions when evaluating the `IN` expressions. This
commit eliminates those unnecessary conversions, drastically speeding up
execution of the query.

Release note (performance improvement): Some types of queries with
comparisons with constant values now execute faster.

26825291,PullRequestEvent,"**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**

There are issues which prevent us from successfully building both the RPM and DEB packages at the moment...

1. See https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/issues/1721
2. Regards building deb packages on CentOS 7, see https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/5252#issuecomment-684846695
3. We also need to add a WINE environment for building the Windows package."
26825291,PullRequestEvent,"## What does this PR do?

This PR introduces auto-detection of Logstash's log file format (plaintext or JSON) and calls the appropriate ingest pipeline for parsing.

## Why is it important?

The `logstash` Filebeat module has always has the ability to parse either plaintext or JSON logs emitted by Logstash. Prior to this PR users would need to manually choose a format by specifying the `var.format` configuration setting in their Logstash module configuration. 

With this PR they will no longer need to manually choose the format; the module will auto-detect it for them. This is in line with what we do in the `elasticsearch` Filebeat module.

This change is also a requirement for migration modules to packages (see https://github.com/elastic/package-registry/pull/270#discussion_r393719035).

74758351,PullRequestEvent,"### Description of the Change

As mentioned in #262 - ```pip3 install prom2teams``` errors out in a [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) without write access to ```/usr/local/etc```.

This change uses [sys.prefix](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.prefix) to get the path prefix - default is ```/usr/local```.

For venv use cases, sys.prefix will point to the virtual environment and ```<virtual_env>/etc/prom2teams/wsgi.py``` will be created.
<!--

We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion. Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the concepts.

### [`v1.5.1`](https://togithub.com/cpplint/cpplint/blob/HEAD/changelog.rst#&#8203;151-2020-06-05)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/cpplint/cpplint/compare/1.5.0...1.5.1)

-   Revert [#&#8203;43](https://togithub.com/cpplint/cpplint/issues/43) behavior change for include order from 1.5.0, and hide it behind command-line-flag `--includeorder=standardcfirst`.
    It turns out there is no easy objective way to tell c system headers from certain c++ library headers, and Google cpplint intentionally classifies some C++ header includes as C system header for simplicity.
-   Libraries considered as C system headers using --includeorder=standardcfirst now also includes linux-specifc headers (glibc-devel, glibc-kernheaders, linux-libc-dev).

### [`v1.5.0`](https://togithub.com/cpplint/cpplint/blob/HEAD/changelog.rst#&#8203;150-2020-05-31)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/cpplint/cpplint/compare/1.4.6...1.5.0)

-   Fix [#&#8203;43](https://togithub.com/cpplint/cpplint/issues/43) false positives in header include order by checking includes against a list of c headers.
    Since this interprets certain include lines different than before, output about header include order changes.

### [`v1.4.6`](https://togithub.com/cpplint/cpplint/blob/HEAD/changelog.rst#&#8203;146-2020-05-31)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/cpplint/cpplint/compare/1.4.5...1.4.6)

-   Fix [#&#8203;135](https://togithub.com/cpplint/cpplint/issues/135): allow 'if constexpr' in readability/braces.
-   Fix runtime warning: Close files after reading contents

### [`v1.4.5`](https://togithub.com/cpplint/cpplint/blob/HEAD/changelog.rst#&#8203;145-2020-01-13)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/cpplint/cpplint/compare/1.4.4...1.4.5)

-   Avoid false positive for \[build/include_what_you_use] in case of `foo.set<type>` and `foo->set<type>` usage.
-   Avoid false positive for \[build/include_what_you_use] in case of `map` is user defined function
-   Escape backslashes in pydoc strings to get rid of DeprecationWarning.
-   Fix false positive ""should include its header"" for 3rd party headers
-   Add support for c++17 tuple destructuring
-   fix [#&#8203;123](https://togithub.com/cpplint/cpplint/issues/123): Inconsistent behavior of --headers and --extensions
-   Fix [#&#8203;114](https://togithub.com/cpplint/cpplint/issues/114): --exclude not working recursively
-   fix [#&#8203;112](https://togithub.com/cpplint/cpplint/issues/112), identifying of copy constructors should allow combinations of volatile and const

### [`v1.4.4`](https://togithub.com/cpplint/cpplint/blob/HEAD/changelog.rst#&#8203;144-2019-02-25)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/cpplint/cpplint/compare/1.4.3...1.4.4)

-   Implement `Log` for `Box<T: Log>`
-   Update `cfg-if` to `1.0`
-   Internal reworks of the structured logging API. Removed the `Fill` API
    and added `source::as_map` and `source::as_list` to easily serialize a `Source`
    as either a map of `{key: value, ..}` or as a list of `[(key, value), ..]`.

### [`v0.4.10`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/log/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;0410---2019-12-16-yanked)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/log/compare/0.4.9...0.4.10)

##### Fixed

-   Fixed the `log!` macros so they work in expression context (this regressed in `0.4.9`, which has been yanked).

### [`v0.4.9`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/log/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;049---2019-12-12-yanked)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/log/compare/0.4.8...0.4.9)

##### Minimum Supported Rust Version

This release bumps the minimum compiler version to `1.31.0`. This was mainly needed for `cfg-if`,
but between `1.16.0` and `1.31.0` there are a lot of language and library improvements we now
take advantage of.

##### New

-   Unstable support for capturing key-value pairs in a record using the `log!` macros

##### Improved

-   Better documentation for max level filters.
-   Internal updates to line up with bumped MSRV

### [`v0.4.8`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/log/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;048---2019-07-28)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/log/compare/0.4.7...0.4.8)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/log/compare/0.4.6...0.4.7)

##### New

-   Support for embedded environments with thread-unsafe initialization.
-   Initial unstable support for capturing structured data under the `kv_unstable`
    feature gate. This new API doesn't affect existing users and may change in future
    patches (so those changes may not appear in the changelog until it stabilizes).

##### Improved

-   Docs for using `log` with the 2018 edition.
-   Error messages for macros missing arguments.

### [`v0.4.6`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/log/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;046---2018-10-27)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/log/compare/0.4.5...0.4.6)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/log/compare/0.4.4...0.4.5)

##### Improved

-   Make `log`'s internal helper macros less likely to conflict with user-defined
    macros.

##### Improved

-   More code generation improvements.

### [`v0.4.2`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/log/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;042---2018-06-05)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/log/compare/0.4.1...0.4.2)

### [`v0.4.0`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/log/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;040---2017-12-24)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/log/compare/0.3.9...0.4.0)

The changes in this release include cleanup of some obscure functionality and a more robust public
API designed to support bridges to other logging systems, and provide more flexibility to new
features in the future.

##### Compatibility

Vast portions of the Rust ecosystem use the 0.3.x release series of log, and we don't want to force
the community to go through the pain of upgrading every crate to 0.4.x at the exact same time. Along
with 0.4.0, we've published a new 0.3.9 release which acts as a ""shim"" over 0.4.0. This will allow
crates using either version to coexist without losing messages from one side or the other.

There is one caveat - a log message generated by a crate using 0.4.x but consumed by a logging
implementation using 0.3.x will not have a file name or module path. Applications affected by this
can upgrade their logging implementations to one using 0.4.x to avoid losing this information. The
other direction does not lose any information, fortunately!

**TL;DR** Libraries should feel comfortable upgrading to 0.4.0 without treating that as a breaking
change. Applications may need to update their logging implementation (e.g. env-logger) to a newer
version using log 0.4.x to avoid losing module and file information.

##### New

-   The crate is now `no_std` by default.
-   `Level` and `LevelFilter` now implement `Serialize` and `Deserialize` when the `serde` feature is
    enabled.
-   The `Record` and `Metadata` types can now be constructed by third-party code via a builder API.
-   The `logger` free function returns a reference to the logger implementation. This, along with the
    ability to construct `Record`s, makes it possible to bridge from another logging framework to
    this one without digging into the private internals of the crate. The standard `error!` `warn!`,
    etc, macros now exclusively use the public API of the crate rather than ""secret"" internal APIs.
-   `Log::flush` has been added to allow crates to tell the logging implementation to ensure that all
    ""in flight"" log events have been persisted. This can be used, for example, just before an
    application exits to ensure that asynchronous log sinks finish their work.

##### Removed

-   The `shutdown` and `shutdown_raw` functions have been removed. Supporting shutdown significantly
    complicated the implementation and imposed a performance cost on each logging operation.
-   The `log_panics` function and its associated `nightly` Cargo feature have been removed. Use the
    [log-panics](https://crates.io/crates/log-panics) instead.

##### Changed

-   The `Log` prefix has been removed from type names. For example, `LogLevelFilter` is now
    `LevelFilter`, and `LogRecord` is now `Record`.
-   The `MaxLogLevelFilter` object has been removed in favor of a `set_max_level` free function.
-   The `set_logger` free functions have been restructured. The logger is now directly passed to the
    functions rather than a closure which returns the logger. `set_logger` now takes a `&'static
      Log` and is usable in `no_std` contexts in place of the old `set_logger_raw`. `set_boxed_logger`
    is a convenience function which takes a `Box<Log>` but otherwise acts like `set_logger`. It
    requires the `std` feature.
-   The `file` and `module_path` values in `Record` no longer have the `'static` lifetime to support
    integration with other logging frameworks that don't provide a `'static` lifetime for the
    equivalent values.
-   The `file`, `line`, and `module_path` values in `Record` are now `Option`s to support integration
    with other logging frameworks that don't provide those values.

##### In the Future

-   We're looking to add support for *structured* logging - the inclusion of extra key-value pairs of
    information in a log event in addition to the normal string message. This should be able to be
    added in a backwards compatible manner to the 0.4.x series when the design is worked out.

```

## Motivation
Initial integration pass to use the new `simple-testing` refactor.  See [TRILFRAME-84][4] for more information.

## Testing
Testing is being done manually. See:
- [Jenkins Job][1] - [Console output][2] - [CDash][3] - Appears to be running correctly but we probably need to double check that it's picking up the `packageEnables.cmake` and stuff like that properly.

## Motivation

Fixes a number of minor issues when building for windows (in particular a MinGW cross compile from linux - though most of the issues are applicable to MSVC also). Details of each particular change are in the commit message. With these changes, my specific configuration of Trilinos builds fully for Windows.

## Testing

Automated build testing for all platforms I have access to was done in https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil/pull/3569. No functional changes expected."

## Description

The main thing this PR does is change the TriBITS and Trilinos CUDA-related TPLs from from using `find_package(CUDA)` (or just raw find operations) to using `find_package(CUDAToolkit)` to avoid imported target namespace clashes with downstream CMake projects that `find_package(CUDAToolkit)` (see #10954 and especially https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos/issues/10954#issuecomment-1262363127).

This PR also includes the updated snapshot of TriBITS 'master' which also includes the TriBITS PRs and commits directly on 'master'

* TriBITSPub/TriBITS@aba06e5a

* TriBITSPub/TriBITS@b33a6d8a
* TriBITSPub/TriBITS@c5805daa
* TriBITSPub/TriBITS#525

Of those other changes, the biggest is the renaming of TriBITS packages and TPLs, see the details in:

* TriBITSPub/TriBITS#527


## Instructions for reviewers

1. Please review the TriBITS changes in the TriBITS PRs listed above.  Do **not** try to review the huge patch in the snapshot commit  https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos/commit/082ee037e281ee84e6303fdac4b8901ac51e75e5!
2. Note that the matching TriBITS change for the Trilinos commit  https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos/commit/97961c75d7a9c3c8330ccc184eb8cfd14c90e7a5 is [`cmake/tribits/core/std_tpls/FindTPLCUDA.cmake`](https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos/commit/082ee037e281ee84e6303fdac4b8901ac51e75e5#diff-05c0e4d244fe11893d433ab5cd1fd5c73cbdb2c9013048792bf3aecdc50c0b16).

## Testing

I tested offline the Trilinos PR builds for 'cuda-11' on 'ascicgpu16' and the 'cuda-10' build on 'vortex.  I also tested against the Spack manager build of Nalu-wind and verified that it fixes the build problem reported in #10954.

### Trilinos PR rhel7 'ats2' build on 'vortex'

With that same repo state on 'vortex' I first build on the login node with:

```
$ ssh vortex

$ cd /vscratch1/rabartl/Trilinos.base/BUILDS/PR/pr_builds/

$ env \
    CTEST_SITE=vortex \
    CTEST_DO_TEST=OFF \
  ./run_trilinos_pr_builds.py \
    -c Trilinos_TRIBITS_DIR:STRING=TriBITS/tribits \
    -b 10954-nalu-wind-fix-cuda -r -p ALL_PACKAGES -j 16 -t 4 ats2 \
    &> run_trilinos_pr_builds.ats2.all.build.out
```

Log file [run_trilinos_pr_builds.ats2.all.build.out.txt](https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos/files/9700844/run_trilinos_pr_builds.ats2.all.build.out.txt)

then I ran the tests on launch node with:

```
$ bsub -J pr_builds -W 6:00 -Is bash

$ env \
    CTEST_SITE=vortex \
    CTEST_DO_NEW_START=OFF \
    CTEST_DO_CONFIGURE=OFF \
    CTEST_DO_BUILD=OFF \
    CTEST_DO_TEST=ON \
  ./run_trilinos_pr_builds.py \
    -c Trilinos_TRIBITS_DIR:STRING=TriBITS/tribits \
    -b 10954-nalu-wind-fix-cuda -r -p ALL_PACKAGES -j 16 -t 4 ats2 \
    &> run_trilinos_pr_builds.ats2.all.test.out
```

with log file [run_trilinos_pr_builds.ats2.all.test.out.txt](https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos/files/9700862/run_trilinos_pr_builds.ats2.all.test.out.txt)

There were three failing tests:

```
The following tests FAILED:
	3548 - TrilinosInstallTests_doInstall (Timeout)
	3549 - TrilinosInstallTests_find_package_Trilinos (Not Run)
	3550 - TrilinosInstallTests_simpleBuildAgainstTrilinos (Not Run)
```

As I found before, those fail because you can't install from the compute node with this setup.  But when I re-ran them (as described below)

<details>

<summary><b>Analysis of failing TrilinosInstallTests tests on 'ats2' build</b> (click to expand)</summary>

The 3 failing tests were:

```
The following tests FAILED:

	3549 - TrilinosInstallTests_find_package_Trilinos (Not Run)

```

As I found before, those fail because you can't install from the compute node with this setup.

To make those pass:

```

Wow, the test `TrilinosInstallTests_simpleBuildAgainstTrilinos` failed!  It showed.  The LastTest.log file showed:

```

We did not see that warning when configuring Trilinos on the login node.

I wonder what is going on here and if this is going to impact Trilinos customers or not on this system.

I think we will just have to wait and see what happens.  But if Trilinos can configure successfully without this warning, it must be possible for other CMake projects to successfully call find_package(CUDAToolkit) as well.

Therefore, I am going to assume this is not going to be a problem for application codes.  And if it is, we will work through the issues.

### Testing against nalu-wind with Spack Manager on 'ascicgpu16'

Leveraging the directories I used to preproduce the problem in https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos/issues/10954#issuecomment-1262363127 that already has everything build (except nalu-wind), I used the updated Trilinos branch from this PR and got a passing build for nalu-wind and a partially passing set of unit tests (which was said to be okay in https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos/issues/10954#issuecomment-1262684793).  Details are given below.

<details>

<summary><b>Details for testing against nalu-wind with spack manager</b> (click to expand) </summary>

<br>

I have completed testing of these TriBITS and Trilinos changes on the cuda-11 build on 'ascicgpu16' and for the cuda-10 build on 'vortex' (see above).  Now to test against Nalu-Wind.

The Trilinos repo is in a bit of a mess due to Spack patching and writing a bunch of non-ignored files:

```
$ ssh ascicgpu16

$ cd /fgs/rabartl/SpackManager.base/spack-manager/environments/bug/trilinos/

$ git status

First, I add ignores for these files to the local Trilinos `.git/info/excludes `file.

To update safely I do:

This should not change behavior of any of the existing ATDM Trilinos nighty builds.  It only allows users to set their own flags (as per #8449 and [CII Best Practices build_standard_variables](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/criteria#1.build_standard_variables)).

## How was this tested?

On the machine 'ceerws1113' using the 'cee-rhel7' system, I did:

```
$ cd /scratch/rabartl/Trilinos.base/BUILDS/ATDM/CEE-RHEL7/CHECKIN/

$ ./checkin-test-atdm-cee-rhel7.sh cee-rhel7-clang-asan-dbg \
  --enable-packages=Kokkos,Teuchos,Epetra,Zoltan --configure

$ cd cee-rhel7-clang-asan-dbg/

$ . load-env.sh 
Hostname 'ceerws1113' matches known ATDM host 'ceerws1113' and system 'cee-rhel7'
Setting compiler and build options for build-name 'cee-rhel7-clang-asan-dbg'
Using CEE RHEL7 compiler stack CLANG-9.0.1_OPENMPI-4.0.3 to build DEBUG code with Kokkos node type SERIAL

$ rm -r CMake* 

$ time ./do-configure -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=""-O3"" -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=""-O4"" -DCMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS=""-O5"" \
   &> configure.out

$ grep -B 1 ""[-]O3"" build.ninja | head -n 2
  DEP_FILE = packages/zoltan/src/CMakeFiles/zoltan.dir/all/all_allo.c.o.d
  FLAGS = -O3 -g -fPIC

$ grep -B 1 ""[-]O4"" build.ninja | head -n 2
  DEP_FILE = packages/kokkos/core/src/CMakeFiles/kokkoscore.dir/impl/Kokkos_CPUDiscovery.cpp.o.d
  FLAGS = -Wall -Wextra -g -O1 -fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer -O4   -g -fPIC -std=c++14

$ grep -B 1 ""[-]O5"" build.ninja | head -n 2
  DYNDEP_INTERMEDIATE_FILE = packages/epetra/src/CMakeFiles/epetra.dir/Epetra_dcrsmm.f.o.ddi
  FLAGS = -O5 -g -O0 -Jpackages/epetra/src -fPIC
```

What this test shows are that the flags set with:

```
  -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=""-O3"" \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=""-O4"" \
  -DCMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS=""-O5"" \
```

are correctly being applied to C files, C++ files, and Fortran files, respectively.

It also shows that the flags set with `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=""-O4""` are correctly added **after** the internally-set C++ flags:

```
-Wall -Wextra -g -O1 -fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer
```

which are set in the file `Trilinos/cmake/std/atdm/cee-rhel7/environment.sh`.

It is interesting to note the trialing C++ options:

```
  -g -fPIC -std=c++14
```

come from the following sources:

* `-g`: Comes from `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG`
* `-fPIC`: Comes from setting `CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON` in `Trilinos/cmake/std/atdm/ATDMDevEnvSettings.cmake`.
* `-std=c++14`: Comes from setting `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=14` in `Trilinos/CMakeLists.txt`

So it is interesting to note that the compiler flags that CMake sets itself can't be overridden with `CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS`.   I really don't like that since you are trusting that CMake will always do the right thing.  This is the type of thing that leads people to post-modifying `build.ninja` files after configure completes in some cases :-(

Sphinx docs are failing to build due to the error:

`No module named 'sagemaker.model_monitor'`

*Description of changes:*

This docs build is failing because  'sagemaker.model_monitor' this is a recently imported from Sagemaker's Python SDK, but it was not added to the list of modules to be mocked by Sphinx. This PR fixes that issue.

*Tests*

Tested locally that the fix in this PR solves the docs build.

Not fully. I mean I've done:
```bash
export JOB_NAME=""sleshche-local""
export BUILD_NUMBER=1

23304091,PullRequestEvent,
39766333,PullRequestEvent,"This is based on the recent `master` batch that included `ds/bundle-uri-...`.

Now that `git clone --bundle-uri` can download a bundle list from a plaintex file in config format, we can use the same set of key-value pairs to advertise a bundle list over protocol v2. At the end of this series:

1. A server can advertise bundles when `uploadPack.advertiseBundleURIs` is enabled. The bundle list comes from the server's local config, specifically the `bundle.*` namespace.
2. A client can notice a server's bundle-uri advertisement and request the bundle list if `transfer.bundleURI` is enabled. The bundles are downloaded as if the list was advertised from the `--bundle-uri` option.

Many patches in this series were adapted from Ævar's v2 RFC [1]. He is retained as author and I added myself as co-author only if the modifications were significant.

[1] https://lore.kernel.org/git/RFC-patch-v2-01.13-2fc87ce092b-20220311T155841Z-avarab@gmail.com/

* Patches 1-7 are mostly taken from [1], again with mostly minor updates. The one major difference is the packet line format being a single `key=value` format instead of a sequence of pairs. (In v3, these commits are significantly reorganized from [1].)

* Patches 8-11 finish off the ability for the client to notice the capability, request the values, and download bundles before continuing with the rest of the download.

One thing that is not handled here but could be handled in a future change is to disconnect from the origin Git server while downloading the bundle URIs, then reconnecting afterwards. This does not make any difference for HTTPS, but SSH may benefit from the reduced connection time. The `git clone --bundle-uri` option did not suffer from this because the bundles are downloaded before the server connection begins.

After this series, there is one more before the original scope of the plan is complete: using creation tokens as a heuristic. See [2] for the RFC version of those patches.

Updates in v4
-------------

This version includes squashed-in versions of the fixups that were previously known as ds/bundle-uri-4-fixup.

* Some unused parameters are now marked with UNUSED, since we are introducing those parameters for the first time. In one case an unused parameter should have been used in repo_config_...() instead of git_config_...().
* The GIT_TEST_BUNDLE_URI environment variable is removed in favor of the transfer.bundleURI config option in all cases.
* A stale commit message is fixed to no longer refer to a rename that was split into a different commit as part of v3.
* The documentation comment for `fetch_bundle_list()` explicitly defines a non-zero return value as an error.

Updates in v3
-------------

Most of these updates are due to Victoria's very thorough review. Thanks!

* What was patch 2 was split to be better understood.
* The new patch 2 is only the new test script infrastructure for testing whether or not the server provides the bundle-uri capability. It is extended with other more complicated examples in later patches. The name was rewritten from lib-t5730-*.sh to lib-bundle-uri-protocol.sh and the variable names are renamed with the BUNDLE_URI_ prefix.
* The new patch 3 performs the basic client interaction with the 'bundle-uri' command, while still not being fully wired up on the server side. The tests do check that the client requests the bundle-uri command after seeing it in the server's capabilities. One important difference from earlier is that the check for server_supports_v2() was moved into the get_bundle_uri() method (underneath the vtable) because we need to check the handshake before calling that method. It makes most sense to put the handshake call there, so do it from the start.
* Patch 4 carefully tests how the transfer.bundleURI config blocks the client-side request of the bundle-uri command. Later tests will use the GIT_TEST_BUNDLE_URI environment variable instead.
* The new Patch 5 renames got_remote_heads to finished_handshake in 'struct git_transport_data' and that's it. That new value is then used in patch 6 to indicate if we need to request the handshake in the bundle URI logic.
* Patch 6 creates the ls-remote helper in 'test-tool bundle-uri' as before, but now only makes use of the finished_handshake member instead of creating a new one. The test helper represents an example consumer of transport_get_remote_bundle_uri() without first doing the server-side handshake, which motivates several of the placements of code within that method and get_bundle_uri() earlier in the series. The ""quiet"" option is also removed to simplify the test helper and to always communicate the inner errors to the user.
* Patch 7 adds the server-side listing of bundle.* config values. The test scripts around these config values have been cleaned up since the previous version.
* Patch 8 has another iteration of strbuf_strip_file_from_path() taking the feedback from Victoria and Ævar.
* Patch 9 adds the relative path logic. The definition of the base path is clarified in the commit message and comments. An additional test shows what happens if the server advertises too many parent paths (unfortunately, a die(), and this is marked for cleanup later).
* Patch 10 is identical to the old patch 8.
* Patch 11 completes the work by having the client download the bundles provided by the server list. It fixes an if/else that should have been an if/else-if.  A new test checks that the --bundle-uri=X option overrides the server advertisement.

Updates in v2
-------------

* Commit messages now refer to protocol v2 ""commands"" not ""verbs"".
* Several edits were made to gitprotocol-v2.txt thanks to Victoria's thorough review.
* strbuf_parent_directory() is renamed strbuf_strip_file_from_path() to make it more clear how it behaves when ending with a slash.

Thanks,

39766333,PullRequestEvent,
39766333,PullRequestEvent,"This patch series is the first 9 patches of a larger cleanup/bugfix series (henceforth ""larger series"") I've been working on. The main goal of this series is to begin the process of ""libifying"" the trailer API. By ""API"" I mean the interface exposed in trailer.h. The larger series brings a number of additional cleanups (exposing and fixing some bugs along the way), and builds on top of this series.

When the larger series is merged, we will be in a good state to additionally pursue the following goals:

  1. ""API reuse inside Git"": make the API expressive enough to eliminate any need by other parts of Git to use the interpret-trailers builtin as a subprocess (instead they could just use the API directly);
  2. ""API stability"": add unit tests to codify the expected behavior of API functions; and
  3. ""API documentation"": create developer-focused documentation to explain how to use the API effectively, noting any API limitations or anti-patterns.

In the future after libification is ""complete"", users external to Git will be able to use the same trailer processing API used by the interpret-trailers builtin. For example, a web server may want to parse trailers the same way that Git would parse them, without having to call interpret-trailers as a subprocess. This use case was the original motivation behind my work in this area.

With the libification-focused goals out of the way, let's turn to this patch series in more detail.

In summary this series breaks up ""process_trailers()"" into smaller pieces, exposing many of the parts relevant to trailer-related processing in trailer.h. This will force us to eventually introduce unit tests for these API functions, but that is a good thing for API stability. We also perform some preparatory refactors in order to help us unify the trailer formatting machinery toward the end of this series.

Notable changes in v6
=================
- Mostly wording changes to commit messages. Thanks to Christian for the suggestions.
- In Patch 9, renamed ""trailers"" linked list to ""trailer_objects"" to disambiguate it from the ""char **trailers"" array.

Notable changes in v5
=================
- Removed patches 10+ from this series. Thanks to Christian for the suggestion.
- Reworded the log message of patch 09 to reflect the above arrangement, as suggested by Christian.

Notable changes in v4
=================
- Patches 3, 4, 5, and 8 have been broken up into smaller steps. There are 28 instead of 10 patches now, but these 28 should be much easier to review than the (previously condensed) 10.
- NEW Patch 1: ""trailer: free trailer_info _after_ all related usage"" fixes awkward use-after-free coding style
- NEW Patch 2: ""shortlog: add test for de-duplicating folded trailers"" increases test coverage related to trailer iterators and ""unfold_value()""
- NEW Patch 27: ""trailer_set_*(): put out parameter at the end"" is a small refactor to reorder parameters.
- Patches 5-16: These smaller patches make up Patch 3 from v3.
- Patches 17-18: These smaller patches make up Patch 4 from v3.
- Patches 19-20: These smaller patches make up Patch 5 from v3.
- Patches 23-26: These smaller patches make up Patch 8 from v3.
- Anonymize unambiguous parameters in <trailer.h>.

Notable changes in v3
=================
- Squashed Patch 4 into Patch 3 (""trailer: unify trailer formatting machinery""), to avoid breaking the build (""-Werror=unused-function"" violations)
- NEW (Patch 10): Introduce ""trailer template"" terminology for readability (no behavioral change)
- (API function) Rename default_separators() to trailer_default_separators()
- (API function) Rename new_trailers_clear() to free_trailer_templates()
- trailer.h: for single-parameter functions, anonymize the parameter name to reduce verbosity

Notable changes in v2
=================
- (cover letter) Discuss goals of the larger series in more detail, especially the pimpl idiom
- (cover letter) List bug fixes pending in the larger series that depend on this series
- Reorder function parameters to have trailer options at the beginning (and out parameters toward the end)
- ""sequencer: use the trailer iterator"": prefer C string instead of strbuf for new ""raw"" field
- Patch 1 (was Patch 2) also renames ensure_configured() to trailer_config_init() (forgot to rename this one previously)

#### Short description of what this resolves:


#### Changes proposed in this pull request:
"
26384082,PullRequestEvent,Provide an option to capture display data for a layout.
26384082,PullRequestEvent,"This reflects the `try_write` approach will handles write failures
elegantly, by logging the error and continuing. We do the same with
`move`, `art_set` and `move_art`.

We also handle exceptions on `before_item_moved` and `art_set` plugins
hooks, the latter of which is moved *before* the file operations to
remain consistent with other hook configurations.

That might be a mistake and API-breaking change, another approach
would be to have a new `before_art_set` hook instead.

We also introduce a new hook (`move_art`) for those operations as
well.

The point of this patch is to make it possible for plugins to send a
signal (through the already FileOperationError exception) to callers
that it should skip a specific item or artwork.

This is essential to allow beets to better integrate with other
utilities like bittorrent clients which may rewrite those files. The
rationale here is that some music collections will have *parts* of
them managed by such clients in which case we should be careful not to
overwrite or move those files.

Operations like copy or hardlink are not handled by this, for that
reason. We may also want to do proper error handling for those as
well, that said, but that seems out of scope for this specific
issue (#2617).

## To Do

- [ ] Documentation. (If you've add a new command-line flag, for example, find the appropriate page under `docs/` to describe it.)
- [ ] Changelog. (Add an entry to `docs/changelog.rst` near the top of the document.)
- [ ] Tests. (Encouraged but not strictly required.)

26384082,PullRequestEvent,"## before PR
VM callbacks can't be caught, so code behaves differently at RT vs CT if VM code calls a callback that raises. eg:
* `catch` doesn't work
* on crash, no useful context or stacktrace is shown so we have no idea how we got here

## after PR
* VM callbacks can be caught, all that's needed is an extra arg `registerCallback(.., mayRaise=true)`
* the exception (whether caught in regular code or if there's no handler, when the program crashes with stacktrace), contains the relevant context
* stacktrace inside VM callback is also shown when nim itself is compiled with --stacktrace:on
* nimscript implementation of callbacks is now simplified thanks to this and shows more informative stacktraces, eg when nim is built with --stacktrace:on
* so things like `walkDir(..,checkDir=true)`, `writeFile`, `removeDir` etc now work correctly in VM
* fixes https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/12676 (`listFiles(..,checkDir=true)` + friends now work; I did not change the default semantic to be consistent with `walkDir`)
* a new way to define internal procs is defined (`{.internalproc.}`), analog to `{.compilerproc.}`, but for semantic phase instead of codegen. This enables writing handlers in pure nim code instead of having to manually write AST; this not only simplifies writing compiler code, but it also allows change those handlers **without having to recompile nim**. A key aspect is that these are **private** (such symbols don't need to be exported).

## example
```nim
proc fun1() = writeFile(""/tmp/nonexistant/bar.txt"", ""foo"")
proc fun2()=fun1()
static: fun2()
# note: try/catch would also work inside VM after this PR (unlike before PR)
```
before PR: no context shown, hard to debug in complex programs

## TODO for future PR's
* after this PR, it should be easy to catch C++ exceptions from CT FFI
* handle similarly `opcNDynBindSym`

## links
* [using readFile at compile time break exceptions - Nim forum](https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/8367)"
26384082,PullRequestEvent,"* the compiler can now issue a warning when it finds that a local stack address can escape its stack frame, making things like `ptr T` a lot safer
* this makes things like https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pull/14869 escape-safe, allowing safe views into data structures
* see extensive tests in this PR in tests/misc/tviewfroms.nim
* correctly handles complex cases involving var/non-var params/result, globals, nested procs, arrays, local vars in arbitrarily nested scopes (including parent scopes), generics (each instantiated proc will have its own dependency graph) and correctly propagates dependencies through proc parameters

## example (see a lot more in tviewfroms.nim)
for example, the compiler figures out that fn.result depends on a2 but not a1, and uses that to infer that `result = fn(b1.addr, b2.addr)` is illegal but `result = fn(b2.addr, b1.addr)` is legal:

```nim
block:
  proc fn(a1: ptr int, a2: ptr int): ptr int =
    # result depends on a2, not a1
    result = a2

  proc bad13(b1: var int): ptr int =
    var b2 = 0
    result = fn(b1.addr, b2.addr)
    checkEscape ""'bad13.b2' escapes via 'result'""

    # fn.result depends only on `fn.a2`, so only on `b1`, which is legal here
    result = fn(b2.addr, b1.addr)
    checkNoEscape()
```

## notes
* all the logic for escape analysis is handled in compiler/lifetimes.nim; it figures for each symbol the set of symbols it depends on, and at which dereference level (<=1, can be negative), eg:
```nim
var b1 = a.addr # b1 => (a: 1)
var b2 = b1 # b2 => (a: 1)
var b3 = b1[] # b3 => (a: 0)
```
when it finds a dependency (lhs => rhs) such that lhs outlives rhs, it issues a warnings (which can be turned into an error)

## future work
* extend this analysis to other directions, eg:
track memory originating from static data segment (read only memory, eg used for cstrings `var a = ""foo"".cstring`) to make sure at CT that such memory can't be written to
* more flexible alternative to [Add write-tracking to Nim's func · Issue #234 · nim-lang/RFCs](https://github.com/nim-lang/RFCs/issues/234) by doing similar interprocedural analysis as done in this PR"

Some suggestion for Form tour in onboarding steps:
@surajshetty3416 @umairsy @nabinhait @rmehta  

- sub-module onboarding: Hr contains many sub-modules like shift management, recruitment, Leave Management, etc. we need the perfect design to handle these sub-module onboardings. 
- -we should also cover the save/submit button in the form tour for saving doc help to complete form tour with saving the document. (after that maybe we can remove create entry well it will be covered here).
- Onboarding will be better if it also captures the whole section informs during the form tour. sometimes going through the whole section make the form tour too much lengthy.
- We can also have the option for field groups. use cases:   we can cover fields like from date and to date by a single step in form tour giving description enter period for leave application.


I will create tasks for these improvements if approved.

### What problem does this PR solve? <!--add issue link with summary if exists-->

close https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/14736.

After some investigation, it's hard to remove the call of `extractCorColumnsBySchema` in `LogicalApply.PruneColumns`. Because when pruning columns of `apply.outerChild`, it might remove some CorrelatedColumns(e.g. `LogicalSort.PruneColumns` will remove constants and correlated columns), which will finally affect `apply.CorCols`.

So we still need to call `extractCorColumnBySchema` in the rule of column pruning.

### What is changed and how it works?

Due to the exist of `PruneColumnAgain`, we have to consider other `LogicalPlans` when extracting correlated columns. This PR implements `extractCorrelatedCols` for `DataSource`, `LogicalTopN` and `LogicalWindow`.

`LogicalWindow.extractCorrelatedCols()` might not need to be implemented since PlanBuilder would add an extra `Projection` below `Window` if there are non-column expressions. I implement this method for `LogicalWindow` just in case that the cascades planner may need it.

### What problem does this PR solve? <!--add issue link with summary if exists-->
Previously TiDB stops the service when it failed to write the binlog, but did not exit the process. Now that the binlog architecture has changed, TiDB can exit the process and let the watchdog pull up so that when the binlog writing resumes, the service can be automatically recovered.
Fix https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/15314

### Description
Fix flaky test because when a service is configured in two listeners in an ingress-gateway config entry; it randomly pick the service config from one of the listeners.

This PR moves test for setting non-default connection threshold to `integration/connect/envoy/case-ingress-gateway-simple` to avoid the non-deterministic results.

### PR Checklist

* [ ] updated test coverage
* [ ] external facing docs updated
* [ ] not a security concern

## Backport

This PR is auto-generated from #14827 to be assessed for backporting due to the inclusion of the label type/docs-cherrypick.



The below text is copied from the body of the original PR.

---

### Description
In our Consul docs, [version 1.10](https://www.consul.io/docs/v1.10.x) and older, we had a Consul vs Other Software page that provided some comparisons with some of our competitors. However, the page had some rather outdated information so we took it down temporarily. We now have created a new set of pages and want to make available.

### Testing & Reproduction steps
N/A, this is just adding new docs.

### Links

 [Previous version 1.10 of the docs](https://www.consul.io/docs/v1.10.x) 

### PR Checklist

* [ ] updated test coverage
* [ ] external facing docs updated
* [ ] not a security concern

Updates `jsonpickle` from 1.5.0 to 2.0.0
<details>
<summary>Changelog</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/jsonpickle/jsonpickle/blob/master/CHANGES.rst"">jsonpickle's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h1>v2.0.0</h1>
<pre><code>* Major release: the serialized JSON format now preserves dictionary
  identity, which is a subtle change in the serialized format.  ([#351](https://github.com/jsonpickle/jsonpickle/issues/351))
* Dictionary identity is now preserved.  For example, if the same
  dictionary appears twice in a list, the reconstituted list
  will now contain two references to the same dictionary.  ([#255](https://github.com/jsonpickle/jsonpickle/issues/255)) (+332)
</code></pre>
<h1>v1.5.2</h1>
<pre><code>* Patch release to avoid the change in behavior from the preservation
  of dict identity.  The next release will be v2.0.0.  ([#351](https://github.com/jsonpickle/jsonpickle/issues/351))
* This relese does *not* include the performance improvements
  from v1.5.1.
* Pandas DataFrame objects with multilevel columns are now supported.
  ([#346](https://github.com/jsonpickle/jsonpickle/issues/346)) (+347)
* Numpy 1.20 is now officially supported.  ([#336](https://github.com/jsonpickle/jsonpickle/issues/336))
* Python 3.9 is now officially supported.  (+348)
* Achieved a small speedup for _get_flattener by merging type checks. (+349)
</code></pre>
<h1>v1.5.1</h1>
<pre><code>* The performance of the unpickler was drastically improved by
  avoiding tag checks for basic Python types.  (+340)
* ``decode()`` documentation improvements.  (+341)
* Serialization of Pandas DataFrame objects that contain
  timedelta64[ns] dtypes are now supported.  (+330) ([#331](https://github.com/jsonpickle/jsonpickle/issues/331))
* Dictionary identity is now preserved.  For example, if the same
  dictionary appears twice in a list, the reconstituted list
  will now contain two references to the same dictionary.  ([#255](https://github.com/jsonpickle/jsonpickle/issues/255)) (+332)
* Unit tests were added to ensure that sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier
  objects are properly serialized.  ([#155](https://github.com/jsonpickle/jsonpickle/issues/155)) (+344)
* The ``is_reducible()`` utility function used by ``encode()`` is now
  4x faster!  Objects that provide ``__getstate__()``, ``__setstate__()``,
  and ``__slots__`` benefit most from these improvements.  (+343)
* Improved pickler ``flatten()/encode()`` performance.  (+345)

92537531,PullRequestEvent,"This PR adds a way to swap NFTs in an atomic way. Previously it was not possible to swap items without trusting some 3rd-party, this PR solves that.
Additionally, it's possible to set the price for the desired NFT."
92537531,PullRequestEvent,"This is a preparation stage for [polkadot#4212](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/4212). It does not affect any existing functionality.

# What?
This PR contains two closely related but separate changes:
1. Derive `Clone` for `Config`;
2. Implement `Default` for `Config` which is returning not just an empty structure but some reasonable fallback defaults.

# Why?
1. `sc_executor_wasmtime` is designed to [consume](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/s0me0ne/executor-config-fixes/client/executor/wasmtime/src/runtime.rs#L671) the config instead of borrowing it. I believe this is due to the possibility of [replacement](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/s0me0ne/executor-config-fixes/client/executor/wasmtime/src/runtime.rs#L809) of instantiation strategy inside it in some cases. It works fine while config is set by a [constant value](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/master/node/core/pvf/src/executor_intf.rs#L49). The task of execution environment parametrization introduces a need to hold that config as a part of abstract executor structure, owned by that structure. Option are either to rewrite `sc_executor_wasmtime` code  to borrow the config instead of consuming it, or to make it possible to create config clones. By the principle of least impact, the latter approach was chosen.
2. Right now execution environment conifg is set by an external component (in my case by the [PVF executor interface](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/master/node/core/pvf/src/executor_intf.rs#L49)) and that is totally correct solution. Nevertheless, it is pretty logical for any execution environment to provide some failsafe default which can be used out-of-the-box. First case where it could be useful is tests. You don't usually want to define a whole config for test unless you're testing with some specific parameters, you just want some safe defaults. Another case is migrations. After execution environment will have been paramertized, we'll get into the situation with older PVFs which haven't ever got a set of parameters bound to them but still need to be executed with some set of parameters. To provide a default set of parameters from the execution environment itself is just more convenient than to define them as a constant in execution environment interface. Config values used in this PR are nothing new by themselves, they are a verbatim copy of values used in [PVF executor interface](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/master/node/core/pvf/src/executor_intf.rs#L49).

92537531,PullRequestEvent,"tx-pool is driven by ChainEvents: `NewBestBlock` (`NBB`) and `Finalized` (`F`) which can be delivered in arbitrary order.

Existing implementation of tx-pool, handles correctly the typical sequence of events: `[NBB(a), F(a)]`.

Maintenance of tx-pool is performed in two steps:
1. enactment/retracment of blocks, and moving associated transaction between    internal pools (enactment phase), notifying Ready/InBlock/Retracted events
2. sending finalization event for transactions in finalized blocks

Existing implementation does not handle properly `[F(a), NBB(a)]` sequence of events (which was a case for `instant-seal` consensus): enactment phase was not executed when `F` was reported before `NBB` event.

For `F` events coming first both phases of maintenance should be executed. For `NBB` event coming after `F` the enactment phase should not be executed.

This PR:
- moves the enactment phase implementation into single function (`handle_enactment`)  which is called for both NBB and F events.
- introduces the `enactment_helper` which decides if enactment phase of maintenance should be executed for incoming event.

Please note that this PR ignores `tree_route` provided within event, and uses `tree_route` function to compute retractred/enacted blocks.

Consider the following chain:
```
  B1-C1-D1-E1
 /
A
 \
  B2-C2-D2-E2
```

The following list presents some scenarios and expected behavior:
- `NBB(C1)`, `F(C1)` -> false (enactment phase was already performed in `NBB(C1)`)
- `F(C1)`, `NBB(C1)` -> false (enactmant phase was already performed in `F(C1)`)
- `F(E1)`, `F(B1)` -> false (enactmant phase was already performed in `F(E1)`)
- `F(C1)`, `NBB(D2)` -> false (enactment phase was already performed in `F(C1)`, we should not retract finalized block)
- `F(C1)`, `F(C2)`  -> false (enactment phase was already performed in `F(C1)`, we should not retract finalized block)
- `F(C1)`, `F(C2)`, `NBB(C1)` -> false (enactmant phase was already performed in `F(C1)`)
- `NBB(C1)`, `NBB(C2)` -> true (switching fork is OK)

92537531,PullRequestEvent,"https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/11547 didn't actually resolve https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/11510.

`median > self.best_queued_number` caused `best_seen` to return `None` way before there is just 5 blocks left to import, causing `SyncStatus::status` flip to `SyncState::Idle` prematurely and changing `is_major_sync` to `false` as the result even though there might still be over 2k blocks left to import (queue for blocks to import has size 2048).

The solution is to check `median` for `SyncStatus::status` calculation, but leave `best_seen_block` as is (as I'm not 100% of implications of changing it).

Noted items can be followed by ""noted"", placeholders can be followed by ""placeholder"", although placeholders are good for nothing unless there is banking support at some point.

Additional changes not in the original PR:
- now updating for minor changes should be as trivial as just updating FA SCSS/font files, as even the font path variable is set outside of `_variables.scss` (in `public/scss/fontawesome.scss`)
- last time I forgot to update the URL in the partials icon preview, this time I didn't.

I also updated https://github.com/oplik0/nodebb-plugin-fontawesome-test for NodeBB v3, so I can confirm the icons there still work (with the same tripadvisor/meanpath exceptions as in the last PR - they're just not in the font any longer)."

7928251,PullRequestEvent,"Hi there! :)

Motivation:
Traffic is expensive. In fact, it's the most expensive resource we have to deal with. :)

Changes:
- Introduced `fileSize` and `fileInput` (values are used twice after change)
- Added `hasValidFileSize`, utilizing [FileReaderAPI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader)
 - Explicit `false` check (line 69) is on purpose, since function returns `undefined` if FileReader isn't supported or file size just isn't limited.

- Added German translation for uploads.json. Transifex shows 0 strings in need of translation, yet uploads:* is in use."

Hope you can review and merge the change.

BTW, I didn't test regression on the watson-token access, but I think this already deprecated.

8964148,PullRequestEvent,"## Description

We have a [constraint](https://github.com/edx/blockstore/blob/0424dc6/requirements/constraints.txt#L29-L36) on the `cryptography` package because the CircleCI tests use `alpine` docker image on which a Rust dependency is unavailable.

To be able to install [blockstore as a package](https://github.com/edx/blockstore/pull/97) in edx-platform, this constraint needs to be removed (edx-platform is on the latest version of the `cryptography` package).

CircleCI provides [custom docker images](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/circleci-images/) but to be able to use Docker Hub images, to get around the rate-limiting, tokens will need to be set up (I am not clear why we haven't hit that for the `alpine` image). Instead it is simpler to switch to Github actions which is already being used for two workflows in this repo and which a number of other repos in the edx org have switched to.

8964148,PullRequestEvent,"## Description ##
This PR introduces a series of new pipeline tasks that categorize students into specific 'types' for each section of each course.

There are nine types:

 |  | |
------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------
Watch all the videos, do all the the problems | Watch some videos, do all the problems | Don't watch any videos, do all the problems
Watch all the videos, do some problems | Watch some videos, do some problems | Don't watch any videos, do some problems
Watch all the videos, don't do any problems | Watch some videos, don't do any problems | Don't watch any videos, don't do any problems

The intention of this is to display a breakdown in Insights of the ""types"" of users per course section, so that one can see the ""trajectory"" of students who may transition from one type to another as they progress through the course.

Here is an example of how this sort of data could be presented:
![typologie-apprenants-mooc-gdp-unow](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/945577/9217311/b2b9dc1a-407a-11e5-893a-b62a1a3ff8ae.png)

([Source: Unow](http://www.unow.fr/index.php/blog-unow/93-5-facteurs-cles-de-succes-mooc))

Unlike most other reports in Insights, the final data from these pipeline tasks is categorized by course and section (chapter), not by date.

## Sample Data ##
The [""Typologex"" course and sample log files](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B4cEL0pX8qLtfmFkT1FWRmxnZ01nX3J5SEtmbDRtX3ZpTVdXYnNuaktoaVJOX1BtVDZ4UlU&usp=sharing) are designed to help test this feature.

The Typologex course has three weeks:
* week1 has 3 videos, 3 problems.
* week2 has 2 videos, 2 problems.
* week3 has 0 videos, 2 problems.

Sample course activity was generated for the following users:
* Completer1 (Did all videos, all problems)
* Completer2 (Did all videos, all problems)
* Somall (Some videos, all problems)
* Nonall (No videos, all problems)
* Allsome1 (All videos, some problems)
* Allsome2 (All videos Some problems in week1, some videos some problems in week2, and no videos some problems in week3)
* Allsome3 (All videos Some problems in week1, some videos some problems in week2, and no videos some problems in week3)
* Somsom (Some videos, some problems)
* Nonsom (No videos, some problems)
* Sonon (Some videos, no problems)

All of the activity was done on August 4, except for 'Nonall' doing week1's problem3 on August 7 and completer1 doing a video in week 2 on August 7

If you analyze an interval that includes August 4, then ""Nonall"" should be marked for week1 as no videos, some problems. Once Aug 7 is added, Nonall should be revised to no videos, all problems for that chapter.
If you analyze an interval that includes August 4, then Completer1 should be marked for week2 as some videos, some problems. Once Aug 7 is added, Completer1 should be revised to all videos, all problems.

## Test Instructions ##
First, upload the Typologex tracking logs to your devstack (something like `hdfs dfs -put tracking.log-2015080* /data`).

To run the trajectory pipeline on the OpenCraft devstack:

    launch-task TrajectoryPipelineTask --local-scheduler --interval=2015-07-21-2015-08-05 --n-reduce-tasks 3
    launch-task TrajectoryPipelineTask --local-scheduler --interval=2015-08-06-2015-08-09 --n-reduce-tasks 3

To run the trajectory pipeline on the combined devstack:

    export WHEEL_URL=http://edx-wheelhouse.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Ubuntu/precise
    remote-task --vagrant-path ../ --remote-name devstack --override-config ${PWD}/config/devstack.cfg --wheel-url $WHEEL_URL --repo https://github.com/open-craft/edx-analytics-pipeline.git --branch typology --wait TrajectoryPipelineTask --local-scheduler --interval=2015-07-21-2015-08-05 --n-reduce-tasks 1
    remote-task --vagrant-path ../ --remote-name devstack --override-config ${PWD}/config/devstack.cfg --wheel-url $WHEEL_URL --repo https://github.com/open-craft/edx-analytics-pipeline.git --branch typology --wait TrajectoryPipelineTask --local-scheduler --interval=2015-08-06-2015-08-09 --n-reduce-tasks 1

With the sample data, after running the first command (up to August 5), we expect the following. Note that **2 = ALL, 1 = SOME, 0 = NONE**.

    mysql> select chapter_id, username, video_type, problem_type from trajectory_detail order by chapter_id, username;
    +------------+------------+------------+--------------+
    | chapter_id | username   | video_type | problem_type |

To reset the Trajectory pipeline, in order to start testing this from scratch:

    mysql -u root analytics -e ""drop table trajectory; drop table trajectory_detail; delete from table_updates where target_table in ('trajectory', 'trajectory_detail');""
    hive --service cli -e ""drop table trajectory; drop table trajectory_detail; drop table trajectory_max_data; drop table trajectory_source_data; drop table user_problem_attempts; drop table video_usage_per_user; drop table per_student_videos_per_chapter; drop table per_student_problems_per_chapter; drop table chapter_association;""

## Caveats ##
* If a user clicks a link to navigate away from the current unit/page while watching a video, that view may not be recorded. This is a limitation of the existing edX video analytics.
* Since there is currently no way for analytics pipeline tasks to know the structure of each course
(especially in cases where it varies from student to student), we make a number of assumptions:
   * That every student will have access to the same # of videos in each section
   * That every student will have access to the same # of problems in each section
     (if you are using content splits per cohort or randomized content, this could be false)
   * That every video/problem module ID occurs in only one place in the course (i.e. no two
     course sections contain the exact same video module as a descendant)

35031835,PullRequestEvent,"This PR adds explicit [permissions section](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions) to workflows. This is a security best practice because by default workflows run with [extended set of permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token) (except from `on: pull_request` [from external forks](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/)). By specifying any permission explicitly all others are set to none. By using the principle of least privilege the damage a compromised workflow can do (because of an [injection](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input/) or compromised third party tool or action) is restricted.
It is recommended to have [most strict permissions on the top level](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#token-permissions) and grant write permissions on [job level](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs) case by case."

30906710,PullRequestEvent,"### What does this PR do?

Adds a new kubernetes provider option to force the creation of services even if there are no endpoints available.
This results in `503` http responses instead of `404`.

### Motivation

If a Kubernetes Deployment is temporarily not available (scaled to 0), for example due to maintenance, the corresponding service has no endpoints.
The creation of the traefik service failed with `Cannot create service: subset not found` and got removed completely.
Browsing the configured url resulted in an error 404, because the route is no longer configured in traefik.
Furthermore because the route creation is completely canceled, configured middlewares on the ingress (via annotation) like an error middleware are ignored too. 

The route now returns an error code 503 and error middlewares are executed.

The old behaviour can be activated by setting `ignoreEmptyServices=true`

30906710,PullRequestEvent,"### What does this PR do?

This pr adds support for [TCPRoute](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/tcp/) and [TLSRoute](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/tls/).

For `TLSRoute`, `Passthrough` is supported and TLS Termination is supported using `Secrets`.

The code uses the [Gateway API](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api) project [v0.2.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/tag/v0.2.0) tag, and follow changes made in https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/633.

Depending on the Listener Protocol, different modes and Route types are supported.

Listener Protocol | TLS Mode | Route Type Supported
--- | --- | ---
TCP | Not applicable | TCPRoute
TLS | Passthrough | TLSRoute
TLS | Terminate | TCPRoute
HTTP | Not applicable | HTTPRoute
HTTPS | Terminate | HTTPRoute

### Motivation
Add more support for Kubernetes Gateway API.

<summary>Release notes</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/websockets/ws/releases"">ws's releases</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>7.4.6</h2>
<h1>Bug fixes</h1>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a ReDoS vulnerability (00c425ec).</li>
</ul>
<p>A specially crafted value of the <code>Sec-Websocket-Protocol</code> header could be used
to significantly slow down a ws server.</p>
<pre lang=""js""><code>for (const length of [1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, 16000, 32000]) {
  const value = 'b' + ' '.repeat(length) + 'x';
  const start = process.hrtime.bigint();
<p>value.trim().split(/ *, */);</p>
<p>const end = process.hrtime.bigint();</p>
<p>console.log('length = %d, time = %f ns', length, end - start);
}
</code></pre></p>
<p>The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed along with a fix in private by
<a href=""https://github.com/robmcl4"">Robert McLaughlin</a> from University of California, Santa Barbara.</p>
<p>In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated by reducing the maximum
allowed length of the request headers using the <a href=""https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_max_http_header_size_size""><code>--max-http-header-size=size</code></a>
and/or the <a href=""https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_createserver_options_requestlistener""><code>maxHeaderSize</code></a> options.</p>
<h2>7.4.5</h2>
<h1>Bug fixes</h1>
<ul>
<li>UTF-8 validation is now done even if <code>utf-8-validate</code> is not installed
(23ba6b29).</li>
<li>Fixed an edge case where <code>websocket.close()</code> and <code>websocket.terminate()</code> did
not close the connection (67e25ff5).</li>
</ul>
<h2>7.4.4</h2>
<h1>Bug fixes</h1>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause the process to crash when using the
permessage-deflate extension (92774377).</li>

##### Deprecations

-   `Popover`: added new `anchor` prop, supposed to supersede all previous anchor-related props (`anchorRef`, `anchorRect`, `getAnchorRect`). These older anchor-related props are now marked as deprecated and are scheduled to be removed in WordPress 6.3 ([#&#8203;43691](https://togithub.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/43691)).

The `Button` component has been fixed so when `isSmall` and `icon` props are set, and no text is present, the button shape is square rather than rectangular.

##### New Features

-   `MenuItem`: Add suffix prop for injecting non-icon and non-shortcut content to menu items ([#&#8203;44260](https://togithub.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/44260)).
-   `ToolsPanel`: Add subheadings to ellipsis menu and reset text to default control menu items ([#&#8203;44260](https://togithub.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/44260)).

##### Internal

Fix #28761
Fix #27884
Fix #28093

## Changes

### Rerun all jobs
When rerun all jobs, status of the jobs with `needs` will be set to `blocked` instead of `waiting`. Therefore, these jobs will not run until the required jobs are completed.

### Rerun a single job
When a single job is rerun, its dependents should also be rerun, just like GitHub does (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/28761#issuecomment-2008620820). In this case, only the specified job will be set to `waiting`, its dependents will be set to `blocked` to wait the job.

### Show warning if every job has `needs`
If every job in a workflow has `needs`, all jobs will be blocked and no job can be run. So I add a warning message.

6899296,PullRequestEvent,"Fixes [issue 8311](https://code.google.com/p/dolphin-emu/issues/detail?id=8311) (which is responsible for a massive drop in performance in netplay since “expected behavior” is essentially a race condition which may or may not happen depending of what your OS decideds) by backporting more of comex's dc-netplay stuff to remove the send lock and run all network-related events in the network event loop.

- [x] backport the hack to wake up enet_host_service from another thread and run callbacks after that
- [x] remove locking around it
- [x] don't mess with lambdas & RunOnThread, use a SendAsync method or something, which will queue a pointer to a sf::Packet instead (an trigger a send)
- [x] check the usefulness of all locks
- [x] make sure traversal still works (at least, not more broken than master)
- [x] make sure upnp still works too

JMC indicated that this brought performance back to normal when testing. As master isn't usable on linux (possibly OSX too), I wasn't able to infer normal behavior. AFAIK, this shouldn't affect traversal or upnp, as the traversal or upnp code takes effect **before** the networking thread is even started."

45107089,PullRequestEvent,"The UniversalPrompt flow from Duo causes the browser to leave CAS, then return to CAS to complete authentication.  This flow is causing the TGC cookie, (and possibly others) to be sent to the browser with a maxage of 0, which pretty much breaks SSO forcing a re-auth on every service. The root cause of the issue appears to be that there are 2 methods being used to add the TGC cookie to the response.  The response.addCookie method and the response.(set/add)Header method.  The use of the two different ways is causing the bug.  The underlying HttpResponse code adds the 'setHeader' data to the response being sent back to the HttpClient, then it adds 'addCookie' data to the response being set back to the client.. The net effect is anything added using the (add/set)Header methods using the 'Set-Cookie' name gets overridden by whatever is in the collection stored by 'addCookie'.  I understand, the (add/set)Header method is being used to overcome limitations in the current Java API such that the SameSite attribute isn't in API. However, because both methods of setting the cookie are being used, this is causing a 'bug' in cases where the login flow leaves CAS, and returns.

The change basically removes the
'HttpServletResponse.addCookie' call from 'removeCookie' and 'removeAll' methods.  Since the Spring CookieGenerator doesn't take the HttpServletRequest and the addCookieToResponse method takes the request to just get the sameSite policy data, I created a 2nd method that takes the string value but basically performs the same logic.

master: https://github.com/apereo/cas/pull/5984
```
"
45107089,PullRequestEvent,"In 6.6.x, when a pac4j client failed to validate its credentials (e.g. after receiving a SAML error response from the IdP, failing to verify the signature on a SAML response, etc.), the ``DelegatedClientAuthenticationAction`` handled the error by returning a ``stop`` event, causing the webflow to move to the ``stopWebflow`` state.  In 7.0.x and 7.1.x, it will return a ``generate`` event, which does not indicate an error, and the webflow continues on to ``viewLoginForm`` with no error messages, which would be terribly confusing to my users.

This PR restores the 6.6.x behavior.   A test has been added to verify (which fails without the change to ``DelegatedClientAuthenticationAction``).

Currently there is an issue when multiple mfa providers are enabled
along with the selection menu. Even if there's an active SSO session for
the user, an exception is thrown, leading to a redirect to the login
page.

```
If we swap `mfa-composite` for the authentication context that the TGT
has, the issue goes away.

This PR was done in the same vein as [this](https://github.com/apereo/cas/pull/5153) one.
There might be a better place to solve this issue that the one that leads to the exception but I am not sure where that might be.

I've also tried to include a puppeteer test but I am stuck at the point where I'm trying to log in using the TOTP provider.
What I want to achieve with this test is to have a user with an active TGT attempting to login to a service while having two mfa providers enabled -globally-. If I could somehow mock the user being logged in, that would be great but I could not find such an example in the other test cases.

Thanks a lot in advance!"

This issue affects CAS 6.5.0
"
45107089,PullRequestEvent,"Currently the body of the forgot username email has the user's email address rather than their username
eg Your current username is: [mark.allen@xxx.com](mailto:mark.allen@xxx.com)
This was working as expected in 6.3

This is because the body is built from the template ""Your current username is: %s""
Using the parameters 

`val parameters = CollectionUtils.<String, Object>wrap(""email"", query.getEmail());`

This pull request just adds the username to the parameters instead

`val parameters = CollectionUtils.<String, Object>wrap(""username"", query.getUsername());`

It also upgrades the hazelcast version used in driver-hazelcast4 to 5.0.
These can be run with a configuration like below: 

```
Q01CurrencyConversionTest@class = com.hazelcast.simulator.tests.platform.nexmark.Q01CurrencyConversionTest
Q01CurrencyConversionTest@eventsPerSecond = 10_000
Q01CurrencyConversionTest@numDistinctKeys = 250
Q01CurrencyConversionTest@warmupSeconds = 5
Q01CurrencyConversionTest@measurementSeconds = 55

Actually, we can determine these two properties from the arguments of the coordinator script, but I could not manage to access these arguments from the relevant places:

```
Q01CurrencyConversionTest@warmupSeconds = 5
Q01CurrencyConversionTest@measurementSeconds = 55

Currently the start and end times of jet measurements are not synchronized with the start and end times of the simulator tests and I would appreciate any help to achieve this.

Dependabot has been fully integrated into GitHub, so you no longer have to install and manage a separate app. This pull request migrates your configuration from Dependabot.com to a config file, using the [new syntax][new_syntax]. When merged, we'll swap out `dependabot-preview` (me) for a new `dependabot` app, and you'll be all set!

With this change, you'll now use the [Dependabot page in GitHub][dependabot_page], rather than the [Dependabot dashboard][dashboard], to monitor your version updates, and you'll configure Dependabot through the new config file rather than a UI.

12633088,PullRequestEvent,"Consider the domain [('tag_ids', '=', False)] with a many2many field.
It is currently translated in SQL as

    ""model"".id NOT IN (
        SELECT ""model_id""
        FROM ""model_tag_rel""
        WHERE ""model_id"" IS NOT NULL
    )

PostgreSQL does not handle well this ""NOT IN"" expression when the relation table is large, and uses some very inefficient query plan in that case.  This commit changes the above expression to a ""NOT EXISTS"" expression (as below), which is executed with a much more efficient query plan, even with large tables.

    NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM ""model_tag_rel""
        WHERE ""model_tag_rel"".""model_id"" = ""model"".id
    )

This change was motivated by a use-case with 2.7M account moves, 11M account move lines and a relation table `account_move_line_account_tax_rel` with 2.3M lines. The query was timing out (15 minutes), and it now takes 15 seconds.
"
12633088,PullRequestEvent,"**Expected behavior:**
We should be able to remove a `product.attribute.value` if it is not referenced by any `product.template`

**Current behavior:**
If a `product.product` is referenced by a `sale.order.line` and we try to remove a `product.attribute.value` which defines this product, then the variant is archived instead of unlinked.
Also, we removed the link from the `product.template` to `product.attribute.value` (through `product.template.attribute.value`).
At this point, odoo considers that this value isn't referenced by any product, 
and if we try to remove it, we get and exception, coming from the `ONDELETE RESTRICT`
constraint, on `product.product.product_template_attribute_value_ids`.
This is because we still have a reference from `product.product` to `product.attribute.value` 
through `product.template.attribute.value`.

**Steps to reproduce:**

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13200247/143596930-3aaaeb54-3030-43a5-adc5-ec635c22e030.mp4

1) install sale / stock
2) create the following
      - product.attribute: color
      - product.attribute.value: blue, red
      - product.template: pen
3) Attach attribute to the product, and create a sale order line with the variant `red pen`.
4) Now, remove the `red` color from the `pen` template, and the `red pen` variant will be archived.
5) Now, go on the `color` attribute and try to remove the red color.

**Desired behavior after PR is merged:**
If all `product.product` referencing a `product.attribute.value` are archived, then the `product.attribute.value` is archived instead of `unlinked`.

Release note: None"
37807150,PullRequestEvent,"**storage: add `TestMVCCHistories` metamorphic param for peek bounds**

This patch adds a metamorphic test parameter that enables peek bounds
for MVCC range key-related commands. These peek bounds will always
result in identical, correct MVCC stats.

Unfortunately, we can't assert that the peek bounds are enforced,
because importing the `spanset` package causes a cyclic dependency.

Release note: None
  
**storage: use `del_range_ts` in `TestMVCCHistories`**

Many of the early `TestMVCCHistories` tests for MVCC range tombstones
used the direct engine method `put_rangekey` rather than the MVCC range
tombstone write `del_range_ts` (which does conflict checks, MVCC stats
adjustments, etc), because the latter did not exist yet.

This patch migrates most tests to `del_range_ts`, and also renames some
of the test files to refer to range tombstone rather than range key.
Stats assertions have also been enabled for some tests.

There are no significant changes to the tests themselves.

Release note: None
  
**storage: add `TestMVCCHistories` cases**

This patch adds additional test cases for `TestMVCCHistories`. These
were primarily designed by deliberately introducing bugs in MVCC code
that did not cause existing test cases to fail.

Resolves #86655.

Release note: None"
37807150,PullRequestEvent,"By default, verbose logging from the s3_storage module would be sent to STDOUT. This has proven confusing in some production situations.

This change installs sets the required configuration to direct S3 logs to the DEV channel.

A side-effect of this is that we will need to be sure to ask for unredacted logs if we want to see any meaningful content.

Release note (ops change): Logs produced by setting an increased vmodule setting for s3_storage are now directed to the DEV channel rather than STDOUT."

Release note: None"
37807150,PullRequestEvent,"In Go 1.19, struct comparisons saw a significant performance regression, apparently due to the use of `memeqbody`. This patch changes `EncodeMVCCValue` to use field comparisons instead of struct comparisons, which yields a significant performance gain.

Unfortunately, this prevents mid-stack inlining. However, the struct comparison regression is significantly larger than the inlining gains. We should reconsider this once Go 1.20 lands, where the regression has been fixed.

37807150,PullRequestEvent,"#### opt: fix invalid transformation in SplitLimitedSelectIntoUnionSelects

This commit removes some untested logic in
`SplitLimitedSelectIntoUnionSelects` that created invalid expression
transformations. With this logic, this rule could construct an unordered
limit below the `UnionAll` which is incorrect. The bug could cause
incorrect query results.

Fixes #88993

Release note (bug fix): A bug has been fixed that could cause incorrect
results in rare cases. The bug could only present if the following
conditions were true:
  1. A query with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` was executed.
  2. The table containing the `ORDER BY` columns had an index containing
     those columns.
  3. The index in (2) contained a prefix of columns held to a fixed
     number of values by the query filter (e.g., `WHERE a IN (1, 3)`),
     a `CHECK` constraint (e.g., `CHECK (a IN (1, 3))`), inferred by
     a computed column expression (e.g. `WHERE a IN (1, 3)` and a column
     `b INT AS (a + 10) STORED`), or inferred by a `PARTITION BY` clause
     (e.g. `INDEX (a, ...) PARTITION BY LIST (a) (PARTITION p VALUES
     ((1), (3)))`).
This bug was present since version 22.1.0.

Measures time row-level TTL job takes to run on a table:
1) Drop TTL table IF EXISTS.
2) Create a table without TTL.
3) Insert initialRowCount number of rows.
4) Gets number of rows that should expire.
5) Wait for table ranges to stabilize after scattering.
6) Enable TTL on table.
7) Poll table until TTL job is complete.
Note: Ops is a no-op and no histograms are used.
Benchmarking is done inside Hooks and details are logged.

37807150,PullRequestEvent,"Previously, there were no metrics or logging in the load-based splitter.

This was inadequate because there is minimal observability into why the load splitter could not find a split key.

To address this, this patch adds metrics and logging to the load splitter, including counter metrics indicating number of times could not find a split key and popular key (>25% occurrence) and logging indicating causes for no split key (insufficient counters, imbalance, too many contained).

Release note (ops change): Added observability for when load based splitting cannot find a key to indicate the reasons why the load splitter could not find a split key, enabling us to have more observability and insight to debug why a range is not splitting more easily.

## Current Behavior

react-utilities exposes helper functions used almost in every v9 component that:
- implements strict runtime dictionaries which types are widened to non strict type alternative
- are not typed properly, thus allowing to introduce any kind of issues to consumers
- violate rule of misused generics

## New Behavior

react-utilities exposes helper functions used almost in every v9 component that:
- implements strict runtime dictionaries which produce [strict types](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/pull/23019/files#diff-b484da070d877468fdb316e0bc2a1f14073983c1d4170a248e5d77f8d14f9b6a
)
- are strictly typed
- don't violate rule of misused generics

To prevent these issues , react-utilities adds lint rule that will catch those 🔥

## Demo

**Strict property maps via `toObjectMap`**

```ts
// BEFORE

// $ExpectType number | ✅
const test = baseElementEvents.onChange
// $ExpectType number | 🚨 - this is wrong as ""helloDarkness"" doesn't exist
const test = baseElementEvents.helloDarkness

// AFTER

// $ExpectType 1  ✅
const test = baseElementEvents.onChange
// $ExpectError - ✅ Property 'helloDarkness' does not exist on type
const test = baseElementEvents.helloDarkness
```

**getNativeProps**

- exclude props

```ts
// BEFORE

// $ExpectType {a: number, b: number} 🚨 - invalid return type
const test = getNativeProps({ a: 1, b: 2 }, ['a', 'b'], ['b']);
// $ExpectType {a: number, b: number} 🚨 - invalid exclude, invalid return type
const test = getNativeProps({ a: 1, b: 2 }, ['a', 'b'], ['hello']);

// AFTER

// $ExpectType {a: number} ✅
const test = getNativeProps({ a: 1, b: 2 }, ['a', 'b'], ['b']);
// $ExpectError ✅ - ""Type '""hello""' is not assignable to type '""a"" | ""b"" | ""c""'""
const test = getNativeProps({ a: 1, b: 2 }, ['a', 'b'], ['hello']);
```

- exclude props DX:

**getNativeElementProps**

```ts
// BEFORE

// $ExpectType {} - 🚨 No TS error although ""IhaveNoIdeaWhyIamAllowedHere"" is invalid prop to exclude
const test = getNativeElementProps('div', { id: '123', checked: true }, ['IhaveNoIdeaWhyIamAllowedHere']))


// AFTER

// $ExpectType JSX.IntrinsicElement['div'] - ✅ no `checked` present
const test = getNativeElementProps('div', { id: '123', checked: true, className: 'hello' }))
// $ExpectType Omit<JSX.IntrinsicElement['div'],'className'> - ✅ no `checked` + 'className' present
const test = getNativeElementProps('div', { id: '123', checked: true, className: 'hello' }, ['className']))
// $ExpectError - ✅  Type '""IhaveNoIdeaWhyIamAllowedHere""' is not assignable to type '""ref"" | ""as"" | ""key"" | keyof HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>

If a JSX object with a `<div>` other than a string is passed into the content field of a `TooltipHost` / `Tooltip`, the browser will complain with the following error:

> Warning: validateDOMnesting(...): `<div>` cannot appear as a descendant of `<p>`...

To deal with this error, we should only wrap the object in `<p>` if it is type string, otherwise we can wrap it in a `<div>`"

Splits the operations on the mempool into a separate module that implements them in a pure style.

The `Ouroboros.Consensus.Mempool.Impl` module was split into `Impl`, `Impl.Pure` and
`Impl.Types` where:
- `Impl`: contains the monadic side of the implementation, bridging between
  operations on an `InternalState` and the actual `Mempool` API.
- `Impl.Pure`: contains the pure side of the implementation, functions that
  update an `InternalState` according to the rules described on the `Mempool`
  API.
- `Impl.Types`: defines the `InternalState` used to fulfill the requirements of
  the implementation, and the `ValidationResult` used to extend the mempool. It
  is used by both `Impl` and `Impl.Pure`.

From outside of this module, the change should be transparent, as other modules
should only access the mempool via the API, and all relevant items are
re-exported through `Ouroboros.Consensus.Mempool`.

The tests are testing the public operations on the Mempool, so it was decided to keep
them as they are. A couple of tests were added to check that the mutable operations on
the mempool that take inputs (tryAddTxs and removeTxs) are ""distributive"" (if only one thread
performs them):

```
tryAddTxs ( x : y : ...) == tryAddTxs x >> tryAddTxs y >> ...

# Overview

This PR adds a property test for `UTxOIndex.selectRandomWithPriority`.

The `selectRandomWithPriority`  function is designed to:
- select an entry at random from a UTxO index according to a specified list of filter conditions;
- traverse the specified list of filter conditions in order of priority **_from left to right_**.

The test added in this PR provides a basic sanity check to verify that priority order is respected.

# Overview

This PR adds the `getWalletUtxoSnapshot` API endpoint and associated CLI command.

The intended use is for debugging and development.

The endpoint generates a complete snapshot of a wallet's UTxO set, as an unordered list of UTxO entries.

It produces JSON output similar to the following:
```json
""entries"": [
  { ""ada"":         {""quantity"": 8, ""unit"": ""lovelace""}
  , ""ada_minimum"": {""quantity"": 1, ""unit"": ""lovelace""}
  , ""assets"": []
  },
  { ""ada"":         {""quantity"": 4, ""unit"": ""lovelace""}

# Summary

This PR fixes a termination condition in `RoundRobin.makeChangeRepeatedly`.

This initial termination condition was incorrect:

```hs
Right change | length change == length outputsToCover ->
    -- We've succeeded in making the optimal number of change outputs.
    -- Terminate here.
    pure $ Right $ mkSelectionResult change
```

This equality check was based on the faulty assumption that `makeChange` always returns a list of change outputs whose length is _less than or equal_ to the number of user-specified outputs.

However, this assumption is **NOT** valid.

In cases where there are many unique assets in the selected inputs, it's possible for `makeChange` to return a list whose length is _greater than_ the number of user-specified outputs. This can happen when one or more change outputs exceeds either of the following limits:

1. A change output has a quantity of a particular asset that exceeds `maxBound :: Word64`.
2. A change output has a serialized length that is greater than the upper limit defined by the protocol (`4000` bytes).

If `makeChange` encounters a bundle that exceeds either of the above limits, it will split up the oversized bundle into smaller bundles that don't exceed the limits. (See `splitOversizedMaps`.)

This means that the number of change outputs generated by `makeChange` can _exceed_ the number of user-specified outputs. Hence, we need to adjust the termination condition of `makeChangeRepeatedly` to allow for this possibility.

# QA

This PR:

- [x] Adds regression tests `boundaryTest_largeTokenQuantities_{5,6}`. These tests perform coin selections that can only succeed if change bundles are split, in order to demonstrate that the change generation algorithm terminates after only a subset of the UTxO has been selected.
- [x] Adjusts the property test `prop_makeChange_length` to account for splitting of bundles.

# Background

The original motivation for generating one change output per user-specified output was to avoid shrinking the size of the UTxO set unnecessarily. By default `makeChange` will already do this, unless there is not enough ada available in the existing set of selected inputs to pay for all the change, in which case change outputs will be coalesced.

# Performance Impact

The faulty termination condition would cause `makeChangeRepeatedly` to repeatedly expand the set of selected inputs in an effort to optimize the set of change outputs, continuing until the entire UTxO set was exhausted.

## Example

This example uses a `testnet` wallet with:
- 47 UTxO entries, of which:
    - 1 entry is a pure ada entry
    - 46 entries are multi-asset entries.
- around 700 unique assets.
    
We make a payment request for the exact balance of the pure-ada entry, the value of which is around 20% of the total ada available in the UTxO set (when all entries are considered).

Specifying this amount means that the coin selection algorithm is guaranteed to select from among the multi-asset entries when generating the initial selection.

7806257,PullRequestEvent,"When calling the virtual_attribute methods for `custom_attributes` in reports, we are currently loading them upfront via an `includes` statement in the query.  This is expensive for memory, but avoids an large N+1 situation later when calculating the row values.  

Unfortunately, this cached set of rows was never used when generating the miq_report_result_details since the `.find_by` in the `virtual_attribute` method definition will not check if the `custom_attributes` relation has been already loaded.

This patch makes it so that relation is checked to be loaded, and will use the values from the before trying to access anything from the database again in an N+1 fashion


Benchmarks
----------

These benchmarks are currently a work in progress, and contain some incomplete data.  Most of those inconsistencies are noted in below.

Tested on a local machine with the DB running on the same machine, so next to no network based latency for queries is observed. 


**Before**

50 uniq query types executed.  212961 are just the N+1 fetching `custom_attributes`

|     ms | queries | query (ms) |   rows |
|   ---: |    ---: |       ---: |   ---: |
| 472820 |  223205 |    80092.4 | 419419 |

Raw `Benchmark.measure` numbers:

```
281.100000  13.840000 294.940000 (322.186379)
280.330000  12.210000 292.540000 (318.992034)
278.170000  11.730000 289.900000 (316.135889)
```


**After**

48 uniq query types executed.

NOTE:  10141 of the total queries and ~3522ms of the `query (ms)` here are `INSERT` statements into `miq_report_result_details`.  Only takes ~20 seconds to insert into the DB once the rows have been calculated.

When we need to do database lock or connection triaging, it's really hard to tell where each connection originated from because we don't specify an application_name. It looks something like this:

vmdb_production=# select pid, application_name from pg_stat_activity;
pid | application_name
------+--------------------------------------------------
13770 | /var/www/miq/vmdb/lib/workers/bin/evm_server.rb

13984 | /var/www/miq/vmdb/lib/workers/bin/evm_server.rb
The much debated format of the application_name now looks like this:

MIQ [], s[], []
OR:
MIQ Server[], []

Note, the pg backend pid isn't needed in application_name since the pid column in pg_stat_activity is the backend pid. Plus, each of our processes can have more than one spid.

It now looks like this:

vmdb_development=# select pid, application_name from pg_stat_activity;
pid | application_name

In stead of showing the same text in all Remote Console tabs, the browser tab now identifies the VM by its hostname or name. This is very usefull when multiple remote consoles of different VMs are open in the browser. The hostname is the preferred name to show because when it is different from the VM name this is a deliberate decision of the VM owner where he prefers to alter the hostname which defaults to the VM name. An OS-less VM has no hostname, so that's why the VM name is shown when there is no hostname.

702790,PullRequestEvent,"The irq_lock() usage here is incompatible with SMP systems, and one's
first reaction might be to convert it to a spinlock.

But are those irq_lock() instances really necessary?

Commit 6161ea2542c4 (""net: socket: socketpair: mitigate possible race
condition"") doesn't say much:

> There was a possible race condition between sock_is_nonblock()
> and k_sem_take() in spair_read() and spair_write() that was
> mitigated.

A possible race without the irq_lock would be:

thread A                thread B
|                       |
+ spair_write():        |
+   is_nonblock = sock_is_nonblock(spair); [false]
*   [preemption here]   |
|                       + spair_ioctl():
|                       +   res = k_sem_take(&spair->sem, K_FOREVER);
|                       +   [...]
|                       +   spair->flags |= SPAIR_FLAG_NONBLOCK;
|                       *   [preemption here]
+   res = k_sem_take(&spair->sem, K_NO_WAIT); [-1]
+   if (res < 0) {      |
+     if (is_nonblock) { [skipped] }
*     res = k_sem_take(&spair->sem, K_FOREVER); [blocks here]
|                       +   [...]

But the version with irq_lock() isn't much better:

thread A                thread B
|                       |
|                       + spair_ioctl():
|                       +   res = k_sem_take(&spair->sem, K_FOREVER);
|                       +   [...]
|                       *   [preemption here]
+ spair_write():        |
+   irq_lock();         |
+   is_nonblock = sock_is_nonblock(spair); [false]
+   res = k_sem_take(&spair->sem, K_NO_WAIT); [-1]
+   irq_unlock();       |
*   [preemption here]   |
|                       +   spair->flags |= SPAIR_FLAG_NONBLOCK;
|                       +   [...]
|                       +   k_sem_give(&spair->sem);
|                       + spair_read():
|                       +   res = k_sem_take(&spair->sem, K_NO_WAIT);
|                       *   [preemption here]
+   if (res < 0) {      |
+     if (is_nonblock) { [skipped] }
*     res = k_sem_take(&spair->sem, K_FOREVER); [blocks here]

In both cases the last k_sem_take(K_FOREVER) will block despite
SPAIR_FLAG_NONBLOCK being set at that moment. Other race scenarios
exist too, and on SMP they are even more likely.

The only guarantee provided by the irq_lock() is to make sure that
whenever the semaphore is acquired then the is_nonblock value is always
current. A better way to achieve that and be SMP compatible is to simply
move the initial sock_is_nonblock() *after* the k_sem_take() and remove
those irq_locks().

When you have E6+ images in an album that you want to generate thumbnails for the underlying paginator queries every id and queries using an IN operator. This works out but the transformation from the fetch result to the ORM objects takes time and memory when you are about to load millions of images.

### 2. What does this change do, exactly?
It offers a new `batch` option for the `sw:thumbnail:generate` command. Using a batch size changes the behaviour of this command as it uses the paginator in a different mode which steps by classical `OFFSET LIMIT` parameters and therefore is loading data only in chunks and can operate it in a way with less memory consumption and without bloating memory to prepare the Paginator without doing any work.

### 3. Describe each step to reproduce the issue or behaviour.
1. Have lots of images to generate thumbnails for
2. Lots of images
3. Force the article album -1 to rebuild every thumbnail

4725494,PullRequestEvent,"Sometimes it is desirable to have a `ManyToOne` mapping from a custom model in a plugin to a default Shopware model. By utilizing the attribute model generation, this commit dynamically adds properties to the attribute models, which have the inverting `OneToMany` annotation. In addition, a custom constructor for initializing the `ArrayCollection`s as well as respective getter functions are added. This is done by just adding the `ManyToOne` annotation to a property in a custom model and setting the `targetEntity` and `inversedBy` attributes accordingly. That information will then be used to determine the name of the property and getter method in the generated model.

Example:
```php
<?php

namespace Shopware\CustomModels\UniquePrefix;

...

/**
 * @ORM\Table(name=""s_test_attribute_feature"")
 * @ORM\Entity
 */
class AttributeFeature extends ModelEntity
{

	...

	/**
	 * OWNING SIDE
	 *
	 * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity=""Shopware\Models\Attribute\Blog"", inversedBy=""uniquePrefixAttributeFeatures"")
	 * @ORM\JoinColumn(name=""attribute_id"", referencedColumnName=""id"")
	 */
	private $attribute;

	...

}

```

Please note that it's essential to use a unique prefix for the `inversedBy` attribute, since an exception will be thrown, if any two generated `OneToMany` properties have the same name. Additionally, only models, which are registered in the namespace `Shopware\CustomModels`, will be considered when generating the inverting `OneToMany` properties.

To create such a mapping in a plugin, just add the following steps to the plugin `Bootstrap.php`:
```php
// 1. Register the custom models:
$this->registerCustomModels();

// 2. Re-generate the referenced ('inversedBy') attribute models
Shopware()->Models()->generateAttributeModels(array(
	's_blog_attributes'
));

// 3. Create the schema for the custom models
$em = Shopware()->Models();
$tool = new \Doctrine\ORM\Tools\SchemaTool($em);
$tool->createSchema(array(
	$em->getClassMetadata('Shopware\CustomModels\UniquePrefix\AttributeFeature')
));
```

Steps `2.` and `3.` can be performed in any order. However, the custom models having the `ManyToOne` mappings must be registered before, using `registerCustomModels()` as defined in `Shopware_Components_Plugin_Bootstrap`."

### Description
This adjusts the logic in `AppellantSubstitution` to ensure that request issues that were closed on the source appeal due to death dismissal are reopened when copied to the target appeal. This fixes a bug that prevented attorney checkout from completing with these issues.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Code compiles correctly
- [ ] Decided request issues (with `dismissed_death` DecisionIssue) from source appeal have `nil` for `closed_status` and `closed_at` on target appeal

### Testing Plan
You can see the basics in the updated model test for `AppellantSubstitution`

For manual testing, and to ensure that the attorney checkout flow continues to work, perform these steps:
1. Use one of the death-dismissed cases for veteran ID `54545454` (for proper setup, you may need to `make reset` or follow the code in `Seeds::Substitutions` to create the appeal with correct request issue / decision issue relationships)
2. Perform a substitution and note the uuid of the new appeal stream
3. Create new judge/attorney tasks (in order to bypass difficult-to-replicate distribution process)
```ruby
uuid = """" # copy from URL of new/substitution appeal stream
target_appeal = Appeal.find_by(uuid: uuid)

judge_user = User.find_by_css_id(""BVAAABSHIRE"")
attorney_user = User.find_by_css_id(""BVAEERDMAN"")

# Create judge task
parent_task = FactoryBot.create(
  :ama_judge_decision_review_task,
  assigned_to: judge_user,
  parent: target_appeal.root_task
)

# Create attorney task
FactoryBot.create(
  :ama_attorney_task,
  :in_progress,
  assigned_to: attorney_user,
  assigned_by: judge_user,
  parent: parent_task
)

```
4. Log in as the attorney (BVAEERDMAN), and go to Case Details for the new/target/substitution appeal
5. Choose task action to draft decision and add a decision for the existing request issue

### Description
Correctly handles the ""Mark as complete: Reschedule hearing"" action on transcription tasks that aren't descendants of hearing tasks.

### Technical background
Here's the investigation I did to make sure I was covering all possible task trees, and as inspiration for the task trees in the test cases.
```ruby
#
#
# what types of parents do transcription tasks have?

TranscriptionTask.open.map { |t| t.parent.type }.reduce(Hash.new(0)) { |a, b| a[b] += 1; a }

{
 ""TranscriptionTask""=>25,
 ""MissingHearingTranscriptsColocatedTask""=>66,
 ""AssignHearingDispositionTask""=>1403,
 ""ChangeHearingDispositionTask""=>24
}

#
#
# what does a typical line of descent look like for tasks with each of those parents?

def minitrees(tasks)
  tasks.map do |t|
    parent = t.parent
    tree = [parent.type]
    grandparent = parent.parent
    while grandparent.present?
      tree.push(grandparent.type)
      grandparent = grandparent.parent
    end
    tree.join("" - "")
  end.reduce(Hash.new(0)) { |a, b| a[b] += 1; a }
end

#
# with TranscriptionTask parent

tts = TranscriptionTask.open.select { |t| t.parent.type == TranscriptionTask.name }
puts minitrees(tts)
{
  ""TranscriptionTask - AssignHearingDispositionTask - HearingTask - DistributionTask - RootTask""=>25
}

#
# with ChangeHearingDispositionTask parent

tts = TranscriptionTask.open.select { |t| t.parent.type == ChangeHearingDispositionTask.name }
puts minitrees(tts)
{
  ""ChangeHearingDispositionTask - HearingTask - DistributionTask - RootTask""=>24
}

#
# with MissingHearingTranscriptsColocatedTask parent

tts = TranscriptionTask.open.select do |t|
  t.parent.type == MissingHearingTranscriptsColocatedTask.name
end

48994755,PullRequestEvent,"Current Ansible version string comparison for the `test_display_callback.py::test_callback_plugin_records_notify_events` test is incorrect as `2.5` does not compare as less than `2.11`, etc., so the test is being skipped."
48994755,PullRequestEvent,"**This is a backport of PR #825 as merged into devel (4f67a3a9e2f20e5d4da313958881eeef67397011).**

From the current behavior, it seems the goal is to print a common usage message and exit 0 if no sub command was given. Under other circumstances, such as an invalid or missing parameter, exit with 2 and print the normal usage message.

In order to preserve this behavior and make the tests run consistently whether or not they are run in multiple process, a custom error method was created that inspects the error message and exits 0 with the common usage message if no command was given. This is a bit fragile, but inside that method we do not have easy access to arguments passed to the main() function (they could be inferred by inspecting private attributes, but this is probably unwise).

This requires catching the SystemExit in the main() function and deciding there based on sys_args how to handle it.

This fix preservers the existing behavior whil making the tests pass consistently. However, it would be much simpler to rely on the default behavior of argparse and exit 2 in both cases. This would remove the need for a custom error method and exception handling. It would be a change in behavior, though.

Related to #815."

Our integration tests were setting in_vpc (because most use-cases need it) so we missed that setting the minimum possible configuration for an EIP resulted in an exception:

# Description

With `ensure_ascii = False`, the Unicode is serialized as-is instead of `\u` escape sequence.

I believe this will make the serialized result more aligned with the default one in FastAPI.

I have created the public Postman collection as part of my exploration of Dapr.

https://www.postman.com/gkoroscapidesign/workspace/dapr-api/overview

I would like to contribute it to the Dapr repository and take up maintenance so that it is on par with the latest Dapr API version.
I could also happily transfer the collection ownership to the Dapr org.
"
56698301,PullRequestEvent,"# Description

Add support for local Helm repo paths through the already existing `DAPR_HELM_REPO_URL` env flag. By creating two symlinks that point to `charts` directory of each project we're now enabled to use HEAD version of the charts.

eg.

```
mkdir /home/luser/dapr/helm-chart
cd /home/luser/dapr/helm-chart
ln -s ~/home/user/dapr/dashboard/chart/dapr-dashboard dapr-dashboard-latest
ln -s /home/user/dapr/core/charts/dapr dapr-latest

DAPR_HELM_REPO_URL=/home/luser/dapr/helm-charts dapr init --kubernetes --dev --wait
```

## Issue reference

Indirectly related is `https://github.com/dapr/helm-charts/issues/14`, this patch lowers the testing/iteration barrier that's involved in locally testing Helm charts

##### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

-   **APIs always return a Promise.**
-   **pointer:** `skipPointerEvents` has been removed.
    Use `pointerEventsCheck: PointerEventsCheckLevel.Never` instead.
-   **upload:** `init` parameter has been removed from `userEvent.upload`.
-   **upload:** `applyAccept` defaults to `true`.
-   The `userEvent.paste` API has new parameters.
-   `{ctrl}`, `{del}`, `{esc}` no longer describe a key. Use `{Control}`, `{Delete}`, `{Escape}` instead.
-   `{alt}`, `{ctrl}`, `{meta}`, `{shift}` no longer imply not releasing the key. Use `{Alt>}`, `{Control>}`, `{Meta>}`, `{Shift>}` instead.
-   `init` parameter has been removed from these APIs:
    -   `userEvent.click`
    -   `userEvent.dblClick`
    -   `userEvent.tripleClick`
    -   `userEvent.hover`
    -   `userEvent.unhover`
    -   `userEvent.selectOptions`
    -   `userEvent.deselectOptions`
-   `userEvent.upload` no longer supports `clickInit`
    as part of its `init` parameter.
-   Behavior for special key descriptor `{selectall}` has been removed.
-   Support for `keyCode` property on keyboard events has been removed.
-   An error is thrown when calling `userEvent.clear` on an element which is not editable.
-   An error is thrown when event handlers prevent `userEvent.clear` from focussing/selecting content.
-   **tab:** The `focusTrap` option has been removed from `userEvent.tab()`.
-   **type:** `userEvent.type` does no longer move the cursor
    if used with `skipClick=false` and without `initialSelectionStart`.
-   The implementation of pointer related APIs was replaced.
    This might break tests relying on unintended side-effects of the previous implementation.
-   Support for node 10 was removed as it reached its end-of-life.
