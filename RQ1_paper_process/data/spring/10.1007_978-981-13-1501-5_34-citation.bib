abstract="This research paper consists of the development of a python chatbot integrated with specific packages and dependencies having capabilities to perform various real-life applications which can also be packaged with some integrated systems as a personal assistant. Various Web services are used using their APIs so as to make it more powerful and less dependent on python packages. It operates completely on Linux (Ubuntu) terminal. Python command with the {\_}{\_}main{\_}{\_}.py file has been used to run it. Terminal then becomes a live Web-based chatbot service with STT and TTS services. Natural language processing is further done by Wit.ai API which token key is set in the code. Each NLP is done by the API and then processed, and crunched text is sent from the wit engine direct to display terminal.",
