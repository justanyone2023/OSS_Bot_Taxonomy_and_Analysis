abstract="Mental health issues are a major concern for teenagers, and access to affordable and accessible support is critical for promoting positive mental health outcomes. Philobot is a chatbot designed to provide personalized mental health support for teenagers with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) practices. It also offers a chatting moodule that facilitates building a rapport between the virtual assistant and its users. This paper presents the design, implementation, and validation of Philobot's key features, including its fine-grained intent classification system, FAQ retrieval model, and response generation model using top-k sampling. Evaluation results show that Philobot is a promising tool for promoting positive mental health outcomes in teenagers.",
