abstract="Generative AI for text-based applications have gained in popularity with the release of ChatGPT in late 2022 by OpenAI. Users engage with the application via a web-based user interface or programmatically via the API. The details of the model internals and specifics on the training have not been made public, which poses several challenges in better understanding the system. It would be advantageous to have insight into the system to better understand the occurrence of bias and issues pertaining to privacy, among other concerns. These aforementioned issues could be better addressed if the code base used for training these large language models were made publicly available. Since the release of ChatGPT and its underlying technologies, there have been various open-source platforms that have become publicly available. This survey presents an analysis of four open-source platforms for chat-based generative AI. These specific platforms include Open Assistant, Colossal AI, ChatLLaMA and OpenChatKit. This survey evaluates each of the four open-source platforms for chat-based Generative AI based on evaluative criteria consisting of understandability, setup and configuration, community and support, regularity of code updates, as well as system compatibility and efficiency.",
