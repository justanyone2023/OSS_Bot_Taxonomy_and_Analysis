abstract="Aiming at the first steps toward de-coupling the application of multi-robot systems from reliance on network infrastructure, this paper proposes a human-friendly verbal communication platform for multi-robot systems, following the deliberately designed principles of being adaptable, transparent, and secure. The platform is network independent and is subsequently capable of functioning in network-deprived environments--from underwater scenarios to planet exploration. A series of experiments were conducted to demonstrate the platform's capability in multi-robot systems communication and task co-ordination, showcasing its potential in infrastructure-free applications. To benefit the community, we have made the code open source at https://github.com/jynxmagic/MSc{\_}AI{\_}projectGitHub.",
