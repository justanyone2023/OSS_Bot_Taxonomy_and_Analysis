abstract="Malware in the gaming industry presents many forms of risk for users, such as phishing, trojans, malware, and network attacks. Few studies have been published on gaming industry malware. The ones identified were found to be primarily focused mainly on in-game cheat detection, such as cheat clients and aimbots. This paper leverages related research drawn from the broader field of cybersecurity, including, URL-phishing detection and crytpojacking. To detect URL phishing attacks data, we used eight filter, wrapper, and embedded-based feature selection and five machine learning techniques, i.e., AdaBoost, extra trees (ET), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and gradient boosting (GB) where highest accuracy, precision, recall, and F1{\_}score are achieved with RF. We further scrutinize the feature selection and classifiers based on threshold that will help to provide an aggregate simplified recommendation to the user and alerting about the malicious URL. The outcome of whether the URL is benign or malicious can easily be seen on developed bot application named ``Fish Finder.'' For allowing Discord users to protect themselves from future phishing attacks, we have shared the built application on github: https://github.com/Dinnerspy/Discord-Bot-Phishing-Detection.",
