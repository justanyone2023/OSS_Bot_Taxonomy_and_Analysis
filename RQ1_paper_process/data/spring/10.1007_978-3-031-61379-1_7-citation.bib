abstract="Disclosure of personal information about wellbeing and mental health is a nuanced situation requiring trust between agents. Current methods for initial mental health assessments are time and resource intensive. With increases in demand for mental health services and decreases in funding and staffing levels, this paper explores whether conversational agents can be sufficiently `trusted' to collect the sensitive data disclosed in initial mental health assessment, thereby reducing the workload for trained professionals.",
