abstract="The article proposes a Telegram bot to automate the process of evaluating the technology readiness level (TRL). A brief overview of the solutions existing in this area was carried out, a flowchart reflecting the algorithm of the bot, and images demonstrating the appearance of its interface are presented. The bot has been successfully tested for performance: with equal input data, the conclusion about the TRL level obtained at the output of the algorithm coincides with the result of an expert assessment in accordance with GOST R 58048-2017. It is proposed to use the bot as a source of another additional opinion about the level of technological readiness of the project.",
