abstract="Enhancing software productivity would help companies to cut their costs and increase profits. Software metrics rely heavily on the personal experiences and skills of managers in pattern recognition and rewards. Differentiating between actual human effort and machine-generated code can help drive an organization's decision-making process that is rewarding its employees and provide an assistive tool to the managers allowing effective monitoring without micromanagement that has a wide application in managing work from home and other virtual environments. The paper explores the insight into the quality of machine-generated bot code compared to actual human coding efforts. It uses machine learning techniques to identify patterns and gives intelligent insights that can be used as a performance metric for versioning systems and business intelligence. We successfully distinguished between a bot and human-written code with an F1-score of 0.945 using the Light Gradient Boosting Method.",
