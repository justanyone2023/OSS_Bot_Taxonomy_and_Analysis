abstract="Originally, GitHub was just about source control, a safe and decentralized offering to host your code for free (if it was public and open source). When Microsoft bought GitHub, things started to evolve and grow; one of the biggest areas of growth was in automation. From that date, Microsoft saw an opportunity to learn from how they evolved their original Azure Pipelines automation and start afresh with those learnings, eventually growing GitHub Actions into a competing product with their own services. You might ask why they would do this, but ultimately it was in their own self-interest; Azure while powerful can be cumbersome; GitHub is new, fresh, easier to use, and more available.",
