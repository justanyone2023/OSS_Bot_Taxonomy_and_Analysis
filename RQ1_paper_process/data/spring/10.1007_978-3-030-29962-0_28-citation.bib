abstract="Web bots are used to automate client interactions with websites, which facilitates large-scale web measurements. However, websites may employ web bot detection. When they do, their response to a bot may differ from responses to regular browsers. The discrimination can result in deviating content, restriction of resources or even the exclusion of a bot from a website. This places strict restrictions upon studies: the more bot detection takes place, the more results must be manually verified to confirm the bot's findings.",
