abstract = {A series of time-dependent radiative/convective models are presented for the atmosphere of Uranus. The effects of atmospheric dynamics have been omitted from the models. The inclination of the pole of rotation to the pole of the orbit, approximately 90°, produces large seasonal changes in the insolation. Because of the relatively small flow of heat from the interior, these seasonal changes cause the effective temperature, which is about 60°K, to vary through the 84-year orbital period by ∼5°K at the poles, ∼4°K at ±60° latitude, ∼2°K at ±30° latitude, and ∼0.5°K at the equator. For a particular latitude, the minimum effective temperature and the maximum convective flow of heat from the interior occur near the end of the period when the sun remains below the horizon during the Uranian day. If the methane mixing ratio is not limited by its saturated vapor pressure (SVP) in the convective region, the maximum convective flow would be a few times the orbital average convective flow and persist for an interval of several years. On the other hand, if the methane mixing ratio is limited by its SVP in the convective regions, the maximum convective flow could be orders of magnitude greater than the orbital average and could persist for less than an hour. If the orbital mean internal heat flow is negligible, the difference in effective temperatures between 30 and 60° latitude would be in the range 2 to 4°K. If the internal heat is taken to be about the maximum allowable and is assumed to be redistributed in the interior in a manner to compensate for the minimum in insolation at low latitudes, the corresponding temperature difference would be in the range 12 to 2°K. In either case, the existing theory of atmospheric dynamics for the outer planets indicates that such large temperature differences will drive large-scale motions which would in turn reduce these temperature differences.}

abstract = {We present a type checking algorithm for establishing a session-based discipline in a π-calculus with name matching. We account for analysing processes exhibiting different behaviours in the branches of the if-then-else by imposing an affine discipline for session types. This permits to obtain type-safety or absence of communication errors while accepting processes of the form if x=y then P else 0 that install a session protocol P whenever the test succeeds, and abort otherwise. To this aim we define a type system based on a notion of context split, and we prove that it satisfies subject reduction and type-safety. We implement the type system in a split-free type checking algorithm, and we prove that processes accepted by the algorithm are well-typed. We then show that processes that are typed and do not contain Wait for deadlocks – an input and its corresponding output (or vice versa) are in the same thread instead of in parallel ones – are accepted by the algorithm, thus providing a partial completeness result. We conclude by investigating the expressiveness of the typing system and show that our theory subsumes recent works on linear and session types.}

abstract = {Depositional sequence mapping has been used to analyse the late Devonian to Recent geologic evolution and hydrocarbon habitat of north Alaska and northwest Canada. Eight depositional megasequences have been identified, each of which records a discrete, major phase of basin evolution. The three oldest megasequences are named the Ellesmerian and reflect deposition on a subsiding fold belt terrane. We name the subsequent two megasequences of early Jurassic to Aptian age, the Beaufortian. They record a 100 m.y. period of extension during which a Jurassic failed rift episode was followed by onset of the successful rift episode in the Hauterivian. This extension led to the opening of the oceanic Canada Basin. The final three megasequences record geographically distinct pulses of Brookian orogenesis. The major proven hydrocarbon habitat occurs on the Barrow Arch of north Alaska. This is a volumetrically large, but greatly restricted, hydrocarbon province, which developed as a result of constructive interference between Beaufortian rift and Brookian orogenic tectonics. Two other, relatively minor, hydrocarbon provinces have also been discovered. They are the Mackenzie Delta and Kugmallit Trough provinces of northwest Canada, which developed in passively subsided basins, located just beyond the influence of Brookian orogenic uplift.}

This chapter reviews the present understanding of the organization and functional properties of descending systems and recent advances that have come from single unit recording in awake monkeys using new techniques that reveal the synaptic connections of single premotor neurons with motoneurons of agonist and antagonist muscles. The technique of spike-triggered averaging of electromyogram activity in awake monkeys is yielding new information at the level of individual premotor neurons concerning the sign, strength, and distribution of synaptic effects from descending systems to spinal motoneurons. The chapter emphasizes the role of descending systems in the control of limb movements, although it is recognized that locomotion and other motor behaviors involving axial, head, and/or facial muscles may involve similar principles. It also emphasizes motor control in primates, although relevant data from the cat and other species will be included where no primate data are available.}

First the role of phase space arguments is clarified and the importance of detecting correlations in high energy production experiments as an hint for understanding the underlying dynamics is emphasized. Then two peculiar (and, in a sense, complementary) kinds of correlation in two-particle inclusive distributions are examined: the one coming from multiperipheral dynamics with Lorentz pole exchanges, the other due to “direct channel” resonances. Some general properties of inclusive distributions are expressed in terms of quantities which are suitable for direct measurement.}

There are two sides to managing access to the server resources, namely outside and the inside. It is important to control which and how many entities from outside the system can get at what's inside and in what way. This, however, brings up the issues of user identification, either anonymously or identifiably. Resource mapping, access control, and authentication are often closely intertwined. The server maps the URL into a resource name recognizable by the operating system and determines any access restrictions on that resource. If the access is restricted to particular users, than the server authenticate the requester as one of the users. Several types of authentications are available to web server and structurally all of them work the same way. There are files that only certain people should be able to run. This can be achieved by restricting or allowing access to pages in a variety of ways such as using the IP address it comes from and using the “Referer” header. In this context, each of the servers has particular strengths and weaknesses as Ohio State University DECthreads HTTP Server (OSU) have different people authenticate in different ways, some against the UAF and some against a file-specific password. Compaq Secure Web Server (CSWS) uses arbitrarily complicated access-control logic.}

Numerical methods were used to sort the pollen taxa into recurrent groups, which are groups of taxa with similar occurrences through time. With the aid of the recurrent groups the pollen diagram was interpreted in terms of the vegetational history of the catchment. The calcareous sediments were unsuitable for radiocarbon dating, but a chronology was established by correlation with nearby sites and by comparison with historical records. People may have lived in the mid-Holocene forest, and created small clearances prior to the Ulmus decline. After the Ulmus decline at ca. 3000 BC, the forest became more open, but eventually human activity declined, and clearings were colonised by secondary scrub. Subsequently, Bronze Age people lived by the lake. They cleared substantial parts of the Quercus/Corylus-dominated forests on the slopes and the Tilia-dominated forest on the plateau above. Dereliction and scrub development, particularly by Taxus, at the end of the Bronze Age, was followed by Iron Age colonisation. Superior technology lead to almost complete forest clearance and farming of the catchment, and the origin of the town. The town developed through Medieval time, and cultivation became specialised with Cannabis (hemp) and Linum (flax) cultivation. After the collapse of the hemp industry, arable farming prevailed. The lake becamme highly eutrophic due to nutrient addition from farming and from the town. Eventually a proper sewage treatment was installed. The uppermost pollen record reflects the conversion of the non-urbanised part of the catchment to parkland.}

This chapter focuses on the Windows 2000 Server referred as a popular choice for deployment to Internet-facing networks. Despite Microsoft's poor reputation for security in such hostile environments, it is quite possible to secure Windows 2000. Windows 2000's built-in security mechanisms highlight the poor planning that all too often accompanies a new Windows 2000 DMZ server build. The chapter assists the systems engineer to avoid the most common pitfalls in deploying Windows 2000 to a hostile Internet-facing environment using mostly on onboard, built-in tools. Windows 2000 gives some planning, forethought, and creative nondefault configuration steps. Windows 2000 is too risky at the time of building DMZ hosts; too many older, less secure defaults are retained in the name of backward compatibility. Windows 2000 has the feature of “remembering” service pack installed files and so newly installed components install using the most current service pack version by referencing the source files listed. This somewhat under documented feature enhancement of Windows 2000, introduced in Service Pack 1, saves a significant amount of time and eliminates the human error that used to be associated with making minor system state changes to a running Windows server.}

abstract = {The δ-lactone derived from tetra-N-acetylchitotetraose (TACL) has been prepared by oxidation of tetra-N-acetyl-chitotetraose with iodine. The binding of TACL to lysozyme has been investigated by its inhibition of the lysozymecatalyzed lysis of Micrococcus lysodeikticus cells and by its perturbation of the tryptophyl fluorescence spectrum of lysozyme. At pH 6.2 the concentration of TACL that is required for 50% inhibition of the rate of lysis is 0.7 µm, which is 1/110 of the concentration of the unmodified tetrasaccharide that is required for such inhibition. The association constants for the binding of TACL to lysozyme over the pH range from 2 to 8 were obtained by fluorescence measurements. Their pH dependence shows that TACL binds most strongly to the species of lysozyme in which the carboxyl group of glutamate 35 is dissociated. In agreement with this result, the fluorescence-pH profile of the TACL-lysozyme complex indicates that the pK of glutamate 35 is about 4.7 in the complex, whereas the pK of glutamate 35 in the enzyme alone is about 6.0. The value of the association constant for the binding of TACL at pH 5.0 and 25° is 3.3 x 106m-1, which is 32 times larger than that for the binding of the unmodified tetrasaccharide under the same conditions. On the basis of these results and of the similarity between the known conformation of the lactone ring and the proposed conformation of the transition state for lysozyme-catalyzed reactions (both half-chair ones), we conclude that TACL is a transition state analog for lysozyme. Furthermore, with these results we can estimate that the affinity of Subsite D of lysozyme for the half-chair conformation of the pyranose ring of N-acetylglucosamine is greater by a factor of 6 x 103 than its affinity for the chair conformation and thus contributes this factor to catalysis.}

abstract = {The anterior chamber of the enucleated rabbit eye was perfused with tissue culture medium (TC 199); the temperature of the medium (35°C), the intraocular pressure (20 mmHg), and the rate of perfusion (0·33 cc/min) were controlled. The corneal surface of the living rabbit was bathed with 0·9% sodium chloride solution after the aqueous humor had been replaced with silicone oil. These procedures did not affect the normal corneal thickness for a period of 4 hr. Various degrees of hypertonicity were produced in the perfusing solutions by the addition of various solutes, i.e. sodium chloride, urea, glucose, sucrose, raflinose, and albumin. When a cornea came into contact with a hypertonic solution, its thickness rapidly decreased, reaching a new steady state in 10–15 min. When TC 199 or 0·9% sodium chloride solution was then applied, the thickness rapidly increased to the original level. An analysis of the time sequence of the changes in corneal thickness, from the viewpoint of the thermodynamics of irreversible processes, yielded values for the hydraulic conductivity of the corneal epithelium and endothelium and for their reflection coefficients with the different solutes used. The hydraulic conductivity of the epithelium and endothelium, respectively, was approximately 1·0 × 10−4 mm/min msOm l−1 and 2·3 × 10−4 mm/min mOsm l−1. The reflection coefficient of the epithelium was 1 with all solutes used; that of the endothelium was 0·6 with urea and sodium chloride and 1 with solutes of larger molecular weights than glucose.}

abstract = {The present study describes a series of experiments which have led to a substantially improved serum-free, chemically defined medium (CDM) for long-term culturing of reaggregated fetal rat cerebral cortex tissue. A reduction of the original medium concentrations of the hormones insuline, T3 and corticosterone, on the one hand, and an enrichment of the medium with the vitamins A, C and E, the unsaturated fatty acids linoleic and linolenic acid, and biotin, L-carnitine, D(+)-galactose, glutathione (reduced) and ethanolamine, on the other hand, formed the most important chemical adjustments of the medium. With the aid of this CDM (encoded R12), the light- and electron microscopic architecture of the tissue could be kept in a good condition (superior to that seen earlier in serum-supplemented medium) up to 23 days in vitro. From that time on, the neuronal network lying between the reaggregates degenerated for the largest part, while a portion of the large neurons (probably pyramidal cells) plus some of the neuronal network within the reaggregates degenerated too. This degeneration process continued during the following weeks, but the reaggregates nevertheless retained most of their mass, so that both small and large neuronal cell bodies (visible in transparent regions at the edge of the reaggregates) remained in good condition up to at least 103 DIV. Stout, thick nerve bundles interconnecting the reaggregates, also survived up to this point. Electron microscopic evaluation of such ‘aged’ reaggregates revealed degenerating as well as healthy regions. The latter had indeed retained healthy-looking pyramidal and non-pyramidal neurons, embedded within a dense neuropil which was often traversed by myelinated axons. The numerical synapse density in such selected, healthy tissue regions reached its maximum during the sixth week in vitro, followed by a rapid decrease and a stabilization at about half the peak values. The present culture system has opened the possibility for performing controlled quantitative studies on the relationship between structure and function of cerebral cortex tissues during development and aging, on its dependence on nutrients, hormones and drugs, and on special factors synthesized by the tissue and released into the nutrient medium.}

abstract = {African horse sickness virus (AHSV), of which there are nine serotypes (AHSV-1, -2, etc.), is a member of Orbivirus genus within the Reoviridae family. Both in morphology and molecular constituents AHSV particles are comparable to those of bluetongue virus (BTV), the prototype virus of the genus. The two viruses have seven structural proteins (VP1–7) organized in two layered capsid. The outer capsid is composed of VP2 and VP5. The inner capsid, or core, is composed of two major proteins, VP3 and VP7, and three minor proteins, VP1, VP4 and VP6. Within the core is the virus genome. This genome consists of 10 double-stranded (ds)RNA segments of different sizes, three large, designated L1–L3, three medium, M4–M6, and four small, S7–S10. In addition to the seven stuctural proteins that are coded by seven of the RNA species, four non-structural proteins, NS1, NS2, NS3 and NS3A, are coded by three RNA segments, M5, S8 and S10. The two smallest proteins (NS3 and NS3A) are synthesized by the S10 RNA segment, probably from different in-frame translation initiation codons. Nucleotide sequences of eight RNA segments (L2, L3, M4, M5, M6, S7, S8 and S10) and the predicted amino acid sequences of the encoded gene products are also available, mainly representing one serotype, AHSV-4. In this review the properties of the AHSV genes and gene products are discussed. The sequence and hybridization analyses of the different AHSV dsRNA segments indicate that the segments that code for the core proteins, as well as those that code for NS1 and NS2 proteins, are highly conserved between the different virus serotypes. However, the RNA encoding NS3 and NS3A, and the two segments encoding the outer capsid proteins, are more variable between the AHSV serotypes. A close phylogenetic relationship between AHSV, BTV and epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV), three Culicoides-transmitted orbiviruses, has been revealed when the equivalent sequences of genes and gene products are compared. Recently, the four major AHSV capsid proteins have been expressed using recombinant baculoviruses. Biochemically and antigenically these proteins are similar to the authentic proteins. Since the AHSV VP7 protein is highly conserved among the different serotypes, it has been utilized as a diagnostic reagent. The expressed VP7 protein has also been purified to homogeneity and crystallized for three-dimensional X-ray analysis. The expressed outer capsid proteins, VP2 and VP5, have been purified and used to raise antisera in rabbits. The VP2 antisera neutralize virus infections in vitro indicating the importance of this protein for vaccine development.
Résumé
Le virus de la maladie du cheval Africain (AHSV), pour lequel il existe neuf sérotypes (AHSV-1, -2, etc.), est un membre du genre des Orbivirus dans la famille des Reoviridae. Les composants morphologiques et moléculaires des particules de l'AHSV sont comparables à celles du virus “bluetongue” (BTV), virus référence de ce genre. Ces deux virus possèdent sept protéines structurales différentes (VP1–7) réparties en deux capsides. La capside externe est composée de VP2 et de VP5. La capside interne, ou “core”, est composée de deux protéines majeures, VP3 et VP7, et de trois protéines mineures, VP1, VP4 et VP6. Le génome, localisé dans la capside interne, est composé de dix segments d'ARN double-brin (ds) de tailles différentes, trois grands, désignes L1–L3, trois moyens, M4–M6, et quatre petits, S7–S10. En plus de sept protéines structurales codées par sept fragments d'ARN, quatre protéines non structurales, NS1, NS2, NS3 et NS3A, sont codés par les segments M5, S8 et S10, respectivement. Les deux protéines de petite taille (NS3 et NS3A) sont synthetisées à partir du segment d'ARN S10, probablement suite a l'initiation de la traduction a partir de deux phases de lectures différentes. La séquence nucléotidique de huit segments d'ARN (L2, L3, M4, M5, M6, S7, S8 et S10) ainsi qui les séquences en acide aminés qui en sont déduites, sont désormais connues, représentant le sérotype AHSV-4. Les propriétés des genes et de leurs produits sont discutées. Les analyses de séquences ainsi que celles des hybridations moléculaires des différents segments d'ARN indiquent que les segments codant pour les proteines de la capside interne (core), ainsi que ceux codant pour les protéines NS1 et NS2, sont hautement conservés. Cependant, le segment codant pour NS3 et NS3A, ainsi que deux autres segments codant pour des protéines de la capside externe, sont plus variables entre les différents sérotypes AHSV. Des relations phylogénétiques entre l'AHSV, le BTV et le virus de la maladie hémorrhagique épizootique du cerf (EHDV), trois orbivirus transmis par des moucherons, ont été mis en évidence lors de la comparaison de séquences équivalentes de gènes et de leurs produits. Les quatre protéines de capside majeures de l'AHSV ont été recemment exprimées dans le système d'expression du baculovirus recombinant. Les protéines exprimées sont biochimiquement et antigéniquement identiques aux protéines naturelles. Puisque la protéine VP7 de l'AHSV et hautement conservée dans les différents sérotypes, elle a été utilisée comme outil de diagnostic sensible de groupespécifique. La protéine VP7 exprimée a ensuite été purifiée et cristallisée pour une analyse tridimentionnelle par rayons X. Les protéines exprimées de la capside externe, VP2 et VP5 ont aussi été purifiées puis ont été utilisées pour la production d'antiserum par des lapins. L'antiserum de VP2 obtenu neutralise in vitro des infections virales, ce qui met en évidence son importance pour le développement de vaccins.}

The main resultsare: 1) the homology of the posterior zygal plate in all cornutes and, 2) the non-homology of the spinal process, which can be borne by two distinct plates from the marginal frame. A functional analysis of stylophoran “accessory orifices” as exchange systems is realised: they are interpreted as respiratory structures. Sutural pores of Phyllocystis blayaci and cothurnopores could represent exothecal pore-structures, and lamellipores endothecal pore-structures. Other possible means of respiration are also envisaged in cornutes. A systematic revision of the Order Cornuta is also presented. The new genus Arauricystis is proposed for two species of cornutes previously assigned to the genus Cothurnocystis.. Two new species of cornutes from the Lower Arenig (Lower Ordovician) of Montagne Noire (Southern France) are described, Ampelocarpus landeyranensis nov. gen. et nov. sp. and Thoralicystis ubaghsi nov. sp.. A new cornute from the Llandeilo (Middle Ordovician) of Brittany (Western France), Scotiaecystis guilloui nov. sp. is also described. Finally, a cladistic analysis of cornutes confirms the results obtained by the identification of plate homologies: 1) cornutes and mitrates are sister-groups, 2) Ceratocystis belongs to the stem-group of both cornutes and mitrates, 3) Amygdalothecida and Cothurnocystida are sister-groups and, 4) Protocystites belongs to the stem-group of both Amygdalothecida and Cothurnocystida.

L'analyse morpho-fonctionnelle des “orifices accessoires” des stylophores en tant que système d'échange permet de les proposer comme structures respiratoires. D'autres moyens de respiration sont également envisagés chez les cornutes. Une révision systématique de l'Ordre Cornuta est également réalisée.

Enfin, l'analyse cladistique confirme les résultats obtenus par la reconnaissance des homologies de plaques, à savoir que: 1) cornutes et mitrates sont groupes-frères, 2) Ceratocystis appartient au groupe-souche des cornutes et des mitrates, 3) Amygdalothecida et Cothurnocystida sont groupes-frères et, 4) Protocystites appartient au groupe-souche des Amygdalothecida et des Cothurnocystida.}

All tissues tested contained some antigenic determinants similar to those found in lens proteins and it was demonstrated that all of the major classes of lens proteins contained such cross-reacting groups. The pattern of cross-reactivity varied both qualitatively and quantitatively from tissue to tissue and there were no lens antigens which were found in all of the other tissues tested. The cross-reacting material from extralenticular tissue is not always identical in molecular form to that obtained from the lens. The results of the Osserman tests have been interpreted as indicating heterogeneity in a population of protein molecules which may be based either on a heteropolymer structure or on the selective binding of cross-reacting antigenic moieties. The results described are taken to mean that much tissue specificity is the result of a unique selection of antigens genetically available, any one of which may be found in other tissues, rather than being due exclusively to the possession of some specific protein restricted to that tissue.}

abstract = {During Mesozoic time the Northwest Australian continental margin and the Thakkhola region of North Central Nepal were “adjacent” passive margins, off Northeast Gondwana. The relatively sediment-starved basins provide excellent opportunities for studying the early structural and depositional evolution of the Indian Ocean, during the Triassic/Jurassic rifting stages (Neo-Tethys), and the Jurassic/Cretaceous transition from rifting to drifting. Nepalese and Australian paleomagnetic studies indicate subtropical paleolatitudes during the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic, but higher latitudes of 35–40°S during the Late Jurassic to Early cretaceous, prior to the sustained northward flight of Australia and Greater India in the Late Cretaceous to Cenozoic. The latitudinal position of the basins and type of sediment are related. Principal continental margin formation along the northern edge of eastern Gondwana started in late Permian to Triassic time. By late Triassic-early Jurassic time platform carbonates with thin, lagoonal shales were laid down in a subtropical climate. The Carnian to “Rhaetian” siliciclastics and carbonates show repeated shallowing-upward sequences. Subsequent southward drift of “Greater India” and Australia during mid-Jurassic time replaced carbonates with more siliciclastic sediment input. Widespread erosion was caused during local uplift of parts of the Northwest Australian continental margin as a result of Jurassic late-rift block faulting. A mid-Callovian-early Oxfordian hiatus in Nepal is a submarine condensed sequence and non-tectonic in origin. In Nepal, the overlying 250 m thick organic-rich dark shales, which are correlated to the Oxfordian/Kimmeridgian clays of circum-Atlantic hydrocarbon bearing basins, can be traced along the northern Himalayan range. These shales probably represent an extensive continental slope deposit formed in a “high-productivity of organics” belt. The diverse foraminiferal microfauna of the belt was previously only known from boreal Laurasia. The Callovian “break up” uncorformity off Northwest Australia is actually a post-rift unconformity and precedes the onset of seafloor spreading by about 5–10 m.y. Seafloor spreading, leading to formation of the present Indian Ocean, started in the Argo Abyssal Plain around 155 Ma ago, in late Jurassic time. Australia and Greater India, including Northern Nepal, separated as early as in the late Valanginian, about 130 Ma ago. Altered ash layers off Northwest Australia record an important volcanic phase in Berriasian-Valanginian time. Mafic volcaniclastics in Nepalese deltaic sediments also testify to continental margin volcanic activity, which may be a precursor to the slightly younger Rajmahal traps in eastern India. An important tectonic event off Northwest Australia took place in Aptian time, 120-115 Ma ago, when hemipelagic sedimentation changed gradually into more pelagic sedimentation, with sharply decreasing rates of deposition. In Nepal, this marks the transition from coarse to fine-grained, organic-rich terrigenous clastics, leading eventually to more carbonate-bearing strata during the mid-Cretaceous global sealevel highstand.}

abstract = {Hydrothermal experiments have been performed investigating granodiorite-water, waste glass-water and granodiorite-waste glass-water systems in the temperature range 100–350°C at pressures of 50 or 60 MPa. Experimental equipment consisted of closed-system large-volume gas-pressurised reaction vessels. Run durations lasted from less than one day to one hundred days at fluid/solid mass ratios between 0.4 and 6. Fluids generated in the granodiorite-water experiments were alkaline (pH = 7.4–8.9) with low total dissolved solids (< 500 ppm) and low chloride (< 40 ppm) and sulphate (< 30 ppm) contents. Silica concentrations in solution approximate to theoretical values in the quartz-water system at 100° and 150°C, although 200°C fluids show evidence of re-equilibration during the quenching process. From available thermodynamic data, the chemistries of the 100° and 150°C fluids appear to be governed by feldspar-water equilibria, whilst at 200°C, feldspar-montmorillonite reactions dominate the fluids. Montmorillonite is an identified secondary phase at 200°C. From these preliminary data, the “evolved groundwaters” produced through reaction of granodiorite and water at high temperatures seem suitable for canister preservation, actinide immobilisation and compatibility with bentonite as a backfill material. Two sodium borosilicate glasses containing simulated waste components have been used in a kinetic study of dissolution at 100° and 150°C, 60 MPa. The dissolution of both glasses is governed by parabolic kinetics with run-lengths up to 14 days, and this is interpreted as being controlled by diffusion through a surface layer. This surface layer develops through incongruent dissolution of the glass and is enhanced by saturation of major components in solution and precipitation of secondary-mineral forms. The crystallinity of this alteration layer is increased by increasing time and temperature of the reaction. SEM and XRD analysis have indicated that at 100° and 150°C the layer is largely amorphous with traces of a poorly crystalline dioctahedral smectite. At 200°C the layer consists of fairly well crystallised smectite and at 350°C degradation of the glass is rapid and the solid reaction products are composed of a complex mineral assemblage including smectite, a lithium-sodium borosilicate hydrate, aegirine, riebeckite, albite, stillwellite, zektzerite and two barium molybdates. Some of these mineral phases incorporate and concentrate waste components, e.g., the zektzerite may contain up to 20 wt.% zirconium oxide, 2.5 wt.% caesium oxide and 0.7 wt.% uranium oxide. The rates of release of certain radionuclides have been investigated in granodiorite-waste glass-water systems. This study has revealed that the rate of release of a particular nuclide is a function of temperature and time. Caesium leach rates obtained in this manner are at least an order of magnitude lower than leach rates derived from refluxing dynamic leach tests. This is because incongruent dissolution of the glass, saturation of major components in solution and precipitation of mineral phases incorporating waste components in these closed-system experiments all serve to lower rates of radionuclide release. The work was carried out by N.E.R.C.-I.G.S. under contract to the U.K. Department of the Environment and the Commission of the European Communities.}

abstract = {The study of the physical properties of alkali halide mixed crystals has been a subject of wide interest in the recent past. The main aim of this review is to provide a survey of the current state of knowledge about the nature of imperfections present and their role in understanding various properties associated with alkali halide mixed crystals. An attempt has been made to distinguish different types of mixed crystals, the conditions for the formation of a mixed crystal, the local strains that arise in the lattice due to the difference in the size of the ions that constitute the mixed crystal. The results obtained from various studies such as ionic conductivity, dielectric loss, microhardness, radiation hardening, colour centres, thermoluminescence, optical absorption etc. on alkali halide mixed crystals are presented. The non-linear variation of electrical conductivity, microhardness, half widths of many colour centre bands with composition have been discussed in terms of the concentration of various defects present in them. The aspects of the problem described include: 1.a) Dislocation density and distribution studies.2.b) Influence of dislocations and grain boundaries on transport properties of these crystals.3.c) Role of ionic size on microhardness.4.d) Lesser rate of hardening in mixed crystals due to irradiation.5.e) Stability of colour centres in mixed crystals in comparison with the end products, finally the present position and out look are summarized.}

abstract = {The DNA of cotton, Gossypium hirsutum, has been characterized as to spectral characteristics, buoyant density in CsCl, base composition, and genetic complexity. The haploid genome size is found to bo 0.795 pg DNA/cell. However, the amount of DNA per cell in the cotyledons increases during embryogenesis to an average ploidy level of 12N in the mature seed cotyledons. Reassociation kinetics indicate that this increase is due to endoreduplication of the entire genome. Non-repetitive deoxynucleotide sequences account for approximately 60.5% of the cotton genome (C0t12pure¶¶Abbreviations used: C0t, product of DNA concentration (mol nucleotido l−1) × time(s); C0t12, that C0t value at which one-half of a kinetic component of DNA will have reassociated; C0t12 pure, that C0t value at which one-half of a kinetic component of DNA would have reassociated if only that component were present, calculated as the product of C0t12 × the fraction of the genome in that kinetic component; 5 MeC, 5-methylcytosine; rDNA, ribosomal RNA cistrons. = 437); highly repetitive sequences (> 10,000 repetition frequency) constitute about 7.7% of the genome. (C0t12 pure = 4.6 × 10−4) and intermediately repetitive sequences constitute the remaining 27% of the genome (C0t12 pure = 1.46). Hybridization of 125I-labeled cytoplasmic ribosomal RNA to whole-cell DNA on filters and in solution indicate approximately 300 to 350 copies of the rRNA cistrons per haploid genome. The interspersion of repetitive sequences that reassociate between C0t values of 0.1 and 50 with non-repetitive sequences of the cotton genome has been examined by determining the reassociation kinetics of DNA of varying fragment lengths and by the electron microscopy of reassociated molecules. About 60% of the genome consists of non-repetitive regions that average 1800 base-pairs interpersed with repetitive sequences that average 1250 base-pairs. Approximately 20% of the genome may be involved in a longer period interspersion pattern containing non-repetitive sequences of approximately 4000 base-pairs between repetitive sequences. Most of the individual sequences of the interspersed repetitive component are much smaller than the mass average size, containing between 200 and 800 base-pairs. Sequence divergence is evident among the members of this component. Highly repetitive sequence elements that are reassociated by a C0t value of 0.1 average 2500 base-pairs in length, appear to have highly divergent regions and do not appear to be highly clustered. A portion of this highly repetitive component reassociates by C0t = 10−4, zero-time binding DNA, and accounts for less than 3% of the genome. At least a third of these sequences appear by electron microscopy to be intramolecular duplexes (palindromes) of 150 to 200 base-pairs and to occur in clusters.}

abstract = {This study of waterlain glaciogenic sediments is designed to present both a review and new information on glaciogenic subaquatic deposits of differing age in a number of localities in North and South America and South Africa. The Late Paleozoic glaciogenic deposits of the Parana´Basin in Brazil and the Karoo Basin of South Africa are singled out for special attention as they show a reasonably complete lateral sequence of terrestrial to off-shore glaciogenic sedimentation. Although the environment of subaquatic glaciogenic sedimentation varies from one area to the next, certain common elements are found which can be used to develop a generalized model for both glaciomarine and glaciolacustrine sedimentation. For descriptive purposes, the model is divided into two broad categories: a shelf facies and a basinal facies. The shelf facies is marked by massive diamicton(ite) which may be 200 m or more in thickness and which is frequently overlain by a complex of clastic sediments consisting primarily of gravity and fluid flows. The basinal facies is marked by products of subaquatic slumps and more distal turbidites and glaciomarine sediments. New terminology is introduced. The massive diamicton(ite), which is diagnostic of the shelf facies, probably represents deposition from the base of active ice in a subaquatic environment and is termed undermelt diamicton(ite). The gravity and fluid flows which are usually found overlying undermelt diamicton(ite) and in the basinal facies are subdivided into six categories: glaciogenic subaquatic outwash, glaciogenic suspension flow, glaciogenic chaotic debris flow, glaciogenic subaquatic debris flow, glaciogenic slurry flow and glaciogenic turbidity flow. The relative abundance of undermelt diamicton(ite) and the various types of gravity and fluid flows can be used to define inner shelf, outer shelf, inner basin and outer basin facies of glaciomarine sedimentation.}

However, some reports note complications that are attributed to indwelling ureteral stents. We randomized 64 patients with large renal calculi (stone burden more than 200mm.2) for in situ treatment or treatment with a prophylactically inserted stent. We used a 6Ch round stent with single-coiled ends or a triangular shaped stent with double-coiled ends. Patients were treated with a Siemens Lithostar lithotriptor.† After 3 months we evaluated the results of treatment and post-ESWL morbidity. Of the in situ group (23 patients) treatment complications consisted of fever in 3, pyelonephritis in 1 and steinstrasse in 3. After 3 months 8 patients (35%) were free of stones. Of the stented population (41 patients) treatment complications consisted of fever in 7, pyelonephritis in 1, steinstrasse in 6 and bladder discomfort in almost half of the patients. Stent calcification and stent migration were also seen in 7 and 10 patients, respectively. Calcified stents had been in situ longer than noncalcified stents. The round stents migrated and calcified more often than the more rigid triangular stents. After 3 months 18 of the stented patients were stone-free (44%). We conclude that ureteral stents do not reduce post-ESWL complications. They are clearly associated with morbidity and do not improve stone passage markedly. Therefore, patients with a stone burden of more than 200mm.2 should be treated in situ without auxiliary stenting.}

Diverse experimental assays of cellular adhesiveness are reviewed and the forces applied to individual cells are estimated. A very wide range of the forces applied to cells in different assays suggests that different mechanisms of bonding are dominant for different types of cells and surfaces under various conditions of growth and chemical environment. The peeling mode of separation is most consistent with the magnitudes of applied force used experimentally in the detachment of cells.}

This chapter discusses the hereditary factors causing clinically significant variations in human responsiveness to drugs and the substantial advances made in pharmacogenetics. Along with past much recent work that has been reviewed in the chapter is devoted to these genetically transmitted conditions, but only a few new examples have been described. In the chapter, the term pharmacogenetics is applied to clinically significant consequences of hereditary variations in the handling of drugs. The chapter deals mainly with an increasing body of data on the defects in human and only tangentially with the very large literature, concerning animal experiments. Search for hereditary variations, affecting the way the body handles drugs, has until recently turned up almost exclusively traits inherited as single factors— that is, traits produced by point mutations at a single genetic locus and transmitted, either as Mendelian dominants or recessives. Investigation of the responsiveness of the general population to a drug in terms of the amount of a drug required to produce a given effect may take the form of a continuous unimodal distribution curve or of a discontinuous polymodal curve. Until recently, studies of drug responses that yield a normal or continuous distribution curve have been almost entirely ignored in pharmacogenetic investigations. To construct unimodal, Gaussian distribution curves large populations are required. Furthermore, genotypes are hard to deduce from such curves. In contrast, discontinuous, bimodal, or trimodal curves of response obtained from disorders transmitted as Mendelian dominants or recessives are more easily analyzed because each discrete curve generally corresponds to a different genotype.}

abstract = {Stable-isotopic, clay-mineralogic, and bulk-chemical analyses were conducted on paleosols of the Neogene Siwalik sections in northern Pakistan in order to reconstruct floodplain environments over the past ∼ 17 Ma. The stable carbon isotopic composition of soil carbonate (mean δ13C (PDB) = -10.2%) and associated organic matter (mean δ13C (PDB) = −24.1%) in paleosols representing 17− ∼ 7.3 Ma reveal that floodplain vegetation was dominated by C3 plants. At 7.3 Ma, a shift toward more positive carbon isotopic values began, signaling the gradual expansion of C4 grasses onto the floodplain. From 6 Ma to present, carbon isotopic values for paleosol carbonate (mean δ13C (PDB) = +0.6%) and organic matter (mean δ13C (PDB) = −14.4%) are uniformly enriched in 13C, indicating the presence of nearly pure C4 grassland. The scarcity of kaolinite and abundance of smectite and pedogenic carbonate in most paleosols suggest that rainfall in the region remained 1.0–1.25 m/yr or less for the entire 17 Ma of record. Paleosols in the lower portion of the section lack organic A horizons but have reddish B horizons often containing secondary iron-oxide nodules. Leaching depths of soil carbonate in these older paleosols are typically greater than those in the Plio-Pleistocene part of the section, where organic A horizons are common, and B horizons are markedly more yellow. The combined evidence suggests that the mature paleosols in the pre-7.3 Ma part of the record are dominantly calcareous Alfisols or Mollisols that once underlay nearly pure C3 vegetation, perhaps trees and shrubs, while calcareous Mollisols underlying C4 grassland dominate the upper part of the record. The carbon- and oxygen-isotopic trends in the paleosol record in Pakistan are also evident in the diet of fossil mammals, and in paleosols from Nepal, thus demonstrating that these paleoenvironmental changes in floodplain vegetation may be continent-wide. Local effects, such as the development or intensification of the Asian Monsoon driven by uplift of the Tibetan Plateau, may have led to the expansion of C4 grasses. If, however, the expansion of C4 grasses proves globally synchronous, then a larger scale cause, such as a marked decrease in ϱCO2, may be the driving mechanism.}

CRSCOR is a general purpose program which integrates three tasks: the management, cross-correlation, and graphical display of signals and cross-correlation functions on a PC workstation. Program variables relating to these tasks may be changed through menus thereby precluding the need for recompiling and relinking. Cross-correlation is performed by Fast Fourier Transform with optional use of an 8087 math coprocessor for increasing throughput. The program has a modular architecture with 46 subroutines which simplifies modification of source code if necessary. CRSCOR was developed as part of an overall study of acoustical signals which have interacted with the ocean bottom. From data collected over the continental rise east of Cape Hatteras, tests were conducted on a series of signals from adjacent bottom paths with the grazing angle of each path differing by about 0.3°. Each member of the series was cross-correlated with the first member. Peak values of the cross-correlation function obtained from unfiltered signals were significantly lower than were the peak values from the band-pass filtered (90–200 Hz) versions of these signals indicating that the high-frequency spectrum is more sensitive to path grazing angle than the lower frequency spectrum.}

There are various techniques for separating proteins and nucleic acids based on their chemical and physical properties. In particular, the intrinsic charges of proteins and nucleic acids are much exploited in biochemistry. Electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, ion-exchange chromatography, and mass spectrometry use the characteristic charges of molecules to separate them. Electrophoresis is the motion of charged particles in externally applied electric fields. Electrophoresis is the highest resolution method available for the separation of proteins and nucleic acids. Gel electrophoresis is the most used electrophoretic technique. Electrophoresis evolved from Tiselius' fundamentally simple moving boundary technique in a free solution to one- and two-dimensional gel systems is capable of exquisite resolution of highly complex mixtures. Sophisticated capillary instruments with online detection bring automation to the analytical processes. Most kinds of electrophoresis are relatively inexpensive and easy to perform, and the results are easy to interpret. It is not possible to obtain quantitative structural data from electrophoresis, but valuable qualitative information about the relative charges and sizes of macromolecules can be acquired from it.}

abstract = {Publisher Summary
Effective maintenance of breeding colonies of nonhuman primates is based on a number of factors. The first of these is the basic knowledge of the reproductive physiology of the species involved. The status of nonhuman primate research is such that there are often large gaps in breeding knowledge, particularly in the species that are not normally held in captivity or are heavily involved in research programs. For effective breeding of these animals, it must rely on reports from zoological gardens and private or commercial colonies. Field studies of the animal's activities in the wild are very useful in establishing breeding colonies. The final factor is the common sense husbandry that individuals acquire through work with a large variety of animals in captive situations. This chapter discusses the methods that have been used to breed a variety of species in domestic and international facilities. It also discusses the detection and monitoring of pregnancy, and prenatal growth and development.}

This situation arises not only from the complexity of both the structures and the external loads, but also from safety specifications requiring a precise knowledge of component behavior. The analytical problems derived from normal and abnormal operation covers a wide range of static and dynamic problems. Extensive use of modern, high-speed computing tools is required to solve these problems. Linear and nonlinear analyses for static and dynamic problems use computer programs of varied complexity, leading to the use of newly developed techniques in the area of finite elements and numerical stability of integration methods. The present paper reviews the existing type of analytical problems faced in design, and the methods used to solve them.}

abstract = {An attempt was made to analyze what types of adrenergic receptors are involved in the mechanisms for aqueous humour production and drainage and to determine the maximum effects of these receptors. The parameters determined were: mean arterial blood pressure, intraocular pressure, rate of aqueous flow via Schlemm's canal, rate of flow through uvcoscleral routes and gross facility of outflow. The recipient venous pressure was calculated. Isoproterenol, 0·1 and 1·0 μg/ml, perfused through the anterior chamber increased the rate of aqueous humour production and the gross facility of outflow and tended to increase the rate of uveoscleral drainage of aqueous humour. A dose of 10 μg/ml produced more variable results than the lower doses. Norepinephrine perfused through the anterior chamber at a dose of 1 or 10 μg/ml had no significant effect on the gross facility of outflow or the rate of aqueous formation. Neither isoproterenol nor norepinephrine had statistically significant effects on the intraocular pressure and the recipient venous pressure. Stimulation of the cervical sympathetic nerves to the eye gave a probably significant increase in the rate of aqueous humour formation. After beta-receptor blockade with propranolol, 5 mg/kg, neither the effects on the rate of aqueous formation nor those on the facility of outflow could be elicited. The results suggest that there are adreuergic beta-receptors in the ciliary processes and in the chamber angle of the monkey eye which stimulate the secretion of aqueous humour and increase the facility of outflow, respectively. The average effect of maximum adrenergic beta-receptor stimulation was to increase the rate of aqueous formation by about 30% and to raise the facility of outflow by about 55%.}

The evolution of the contemporary fish fauna of the Baltic Sea has been mostly influenced by (1) changeability of environmental conditions during the short history of this sea, (2) horizontal and vertical configuration of the Baltic Sea, determining its brackish-water character, with dominating two-layered water mass, as well as the character of currents, and (3) climate. The main components of the contemporary fish fauna of the Baltic Sea, the arctic, marine-boreal, anadromous, katadromous, and fresh-water fishes, have immigrated into this sea at different times by various ways. Marine species in the Baltic Sea could have adapted mainly eurihaline species being capable to endure a relatively low temperature. The species composition of its fish fauna was probably different. It is probable that, especially during the Litorina time with the warmest climate and the highest salinity in the history of the Baltic Sea, a number of marine fishes immigrated into the Baltic basin. Because of environmental conditions in the Baltic Sea, a characteristic distribution of fishes has become established. Because of a low content or absence of oxygen in the bottom layers of the deep areas, the fishes are periodically or permanently absent. In the northern part of the Baltic Sea, mainly plankton eating herring and sprat, are constantly abundant and to a smaller degree also the flounder. In the southern and southwestern Baltic Sea, more marine fishes including benthos-eaters and predatory fishes are relatively abundant.}

TYLCV causes economic losses up to 100% in tomato crop in many tropical and subtropical regions, and is spreading towards new areas. The increasing economic importance of TYLCV has resulted in the need for accurate detection and identification procedures, stimulating intensive research efforts focused on virus biology, diversity, and epidemiology to develop successful control strategies. Breeding for resistance appears to be the best approach to control this disease, but to date only partially resistant hybrids are commercially available. Search for new sources of disease resistance needs to be intensified. The purpose of this paper is to collect and summarize all these efforts, offering an updated review of these new approaches on virus transmission, molecular biology, variability, diagnostic methods, and potential ways to control. This will lead to a better understanding of the virus-vector-host relationships, key factors in the adoption of disease control measures.}

abstract = {In this inquiry the author confronts the historiographical view of the rise of the Capetians to power, as represented by the Historia Francorum Senonensis, with historical reality. He comes to the conclusion that the medieval historian, writing in the thirties of the eleventh century, sought by the selection, combination, interpretation, and presentation of his passages to propagate a view which had originated at the archbishop's court at Sens. The actual political motive was the dispute of Sens with Reins over coronation rights; it was this that explains the anti-Capetian tendency of the author's account of the dynastic change in 987. Moreover, it is possible to discern a political consciousness which was able to consider the West-Frankish/French monarchy as independent from dynastic considerations. We are thus dealing not with a historiographical statement of the Carolingian point of view, but with the reaction to a particular situation in ecclesiastical politics combined with a non-personal theory of the state.}

This chapter discusses microbial biomass (MB), which, as a source of nutrients, is receiving worldwide attention. Microbes can be grown in renewable and synthetic substrates, and the resulting biomass can be employed as a nutrient source as produced or after processing through animal feed rations or in processed food products. The imminent world food crisis has encouraged research and development activities related to the production and processing of MB. The standard process for MB production as developed for large-scale capital intensive operations consists of a single-species operation carried out in synthetic substrates, where biomass is reproduced aerobically and continuously in a highly diluted aqueous media under mesophilic temperatures and in large-scale plants. This operation is followed by cell recovery, washing, and drying where a nonviable, easily stored biomass powder is obtained. There is repetitive research work that does not produce new insights to process development; however, there have been outstanding new ideas brought to the general attention, which have increased the number of process alternatives available.}

abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses immobilized living cells, their advantages, and their applications in industry. Over the past two decades, there have been rapid developments in the use of enzymes as catalysts for industrial, analytical, and medical purposes and a new field of research called enzyme technology. Current and industrial applications of continuous single-enzyme reactions are carried out using immobilized microbial cells. Immobilized living cells should be preferred to immobilized enzymes for degradative and synthetic reactions in industry; another major advantage of immobilized cells is that the operational stability of the immobilized living cells may often be greatly enhanced by the regeneration of the enzyme activities of the immobilized cells. The use of immobilized cells enables greater control throughout the reaction. The applications of immobilized living cells are not limited to the production of chemical fermentation products but have been extended to the production of viral particles or synchronous cells, the chromatographic separation of special cells, the culturing of animal tissue, and, more recently, the immobilization and use of plant cells in the production of alkaloids.}

abstract = {In this study I integrate marine and continental biostratigraphy, magnetic polarity stratigraphy, and radioisotopic chronology in a synthetic correlation of middle Eocene strata from the western United States. More than 2000 m of section were sampled from volcaniclastic deposits, Aycross and Tepee Trail Formations (northwestern Wyoming); lacustrine and fluviatile deposits, Washakie Formation (southwestern Wyoming); and intertonguing marine and continental strata, La Jolla and Poway Groups (San Diego area, California). Detailed demagnetization studies on numerous pilot samples from all three field areas revealed moderately complex magnetizations. Most sample NRM's are dominated by a strong normal polarity magnetic component; alternating field demagnetization does not consistently isolate the primary magnetization. High blocking temperature hematite is frequently a significant carrier of remanence. Therefore, most samples were subjected to detailed, stepwise alternating field and thermal demagnetization to 600–650°C. The East Fork Basin area (northwestern Wyoming) magnetic polarity sequence consists of five major polarity intervals, A- to E-; the thick Washakie Formation sequence contains four, A+ to D-; and the San Diego area sequence has four polarity intervals, A- to D+. A new biochronologic interval, the Shoshonian Land Mammal Subage (Earliest Uintan), is defined and characterized. In all three field areas Shoshonian (Earliest Uintan) faunas and the Bridgerian/Uintan boundary occur within a single long reversed polarity interval. Correlation of marine biostratigraphy between the San Diego area section and deep sea sections allows precise identification of San Diego polarity interval B+ as Chron C21N. Therefore, the Bridgerian/Uintan boundary and earliest Uintan faunas occur within the reversed interval of Chron C20R. High-temperature, KAr dates bracketing this horizon in northwestern Wyoming provide an age estimate of approximately 49.5 Ma for the top of Chron C21N and 49 Ma for the Bridgerian/Uintan boundary. Berggren et al. (1985) use the age estimate of 49.5 Ma for the top of anomaly 21 (younger boundary of Chron C21N) as one calibration point for the generation of a Paleogene geochronology. The methodology and conclusions of this geochronology are compared to those of other recent geochronologies. Data from independent studies integrating high temperature radioisotopic dates, biochronology, and magnetochronology are used to test the validity of the Berggren et al. (1985) geochronology.}

abstract = {Summary
An attempt has been made to review the available information on the uses of lactose in animal and human feeding. From the information reviewed, the following conclusions can be drawn:1.Lactose is tolerated by the rat up to about 25% of the diet. Above this level poor growth, diarrhea, alopecia, and cataract formation result.2.Young pigs and dairy calves are able to tolerate extremely high levels of lactose. This tolerance for lactose decreases with the age of the animal.3.Poultry, either young or old, are unable to utilize even moderate levels of lactose.4.Lactose has a definite effect on the intestinal tract of all animals. This effect is characterized by a lowering of the acidity and a change of the intestinal flora to an acidophilic type.5.Lactose stimulates the synthesis of B-vitamins by the intestinal bacteria in both mammals and poultry.6.Lactose feeding causes a change in the phospholipids of the tissues of animals fed diets containing large amounts of lactose.7.Lactose favorably influences the absorption, retention, and utilization of calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium. This may or may not be related to the change in pH of the intestinal tract following lactose feeding.8.Lactose is well-tolerated by the human adult and it may be used in therapy against constipation and diarrhea.9.Lactose finds wide use in infant feeding and should be considered the carbohydrate of choice for the modification of cow's milk and for the formulation of infant foods. It is especially useful as an additive to human milk for the feeding of premature infants.10.Lactose has been shown to improve the problem-solving ability of rats, which suggests a nutritive value not found in other carbohydrates.11.Lactose has been shown to protect the rat against alloxan poisoning. Sucrose and starch did not give this protecting action against alloxan poisoning.12.Lactose has been shown to be a lipotropic agent and a sparer of choline.13.Lactose allows normal reproduction in the rat. This was not true for sucrose.}
