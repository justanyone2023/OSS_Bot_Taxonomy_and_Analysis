abstract = {The results of statistical model calculations of (n,γ), (n,p), and (n,α) cross sections and reaction-rate factors are presented in tabular form for over 500 target nuclei in the range 36 ≤ Z ≤ 83 (krypton to bismuth). Included in these tables is information on (i) the reaction cross section as a function of energy for the exoergic channel in the range 0.01 ≤ E(MeV) ≤ 3.0; (ii) the thermally averaged reaction-rate factor, NA〈σv〉 and the nuclear partition function G(T) for temperatures in the range 108 ≤ T(oK) ≤ 3 × 109; (iii) analytic fits to the reaction-rate factors and partition functions as functions of temperature; and (iv) nuclear level-density parameters and formulas for their extrapolation. Two types of reaction-rate factors have been computed. One, which may be called the “laboratory rate factor,” is based on the assumption that the target nuclei occupy only their ground states. The other, which shall be termed the “stellar rate factor,” is based on the more realistic assumption that the target nuclei occupy a thermal distribution of excited states at temperature T. A brief discussion of theory and instructions for usage of the tables are included. New fitting forms for statistical-model thermonuclear reaction rates are presented and justified.}

abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter focuses on the Taylor series method for the solution of systems of ordinary differential equations, which is one of the oldest and most reliable procedures for integrating systems of differential equations. The method can be formulated in general for differential systems that are reducible to rational form. In addition, it can be programmed as a general purpose algorithm that requires no previous manipulations on the differential system, accepting only the defining system as input. Experience over a wide range of problems and required accuracies have indicated that it does not suffer from numerical instability. It is a flexible, variable-step method that produces a piecewise polynomial solution, valid throughout the entire domain of integration. In many problems, it can attain a significantly greater maximum accuracy than the Runge–Kutta–Gill method, and it proceeds with unusually large step lengths. Throughout a wide range of accuracy, the Bulrisch–Stoer method often requires five times the amount of computing time taken by the Taylor series method.}
