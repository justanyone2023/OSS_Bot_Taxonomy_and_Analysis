In this paper the procedures used for secondary structure determination are reviewed and placed in perspective relative to the other steps in a complete three-dimensional structure determination. As an illustration the identification of the regular secondary structure elements in human cyclophilin is described.}

Nine specimens were tested (and five re-tested) under a variety of loading conditions to provide experimental data on the effects of force and moment distribution, continuity, and end restraints. The experimental data will provide benchmark results for future theoretical analyses on the inelastic buckling behaviour of continuous beam-columns. Results presented include failure load combinations, variations of in-plane and out-of-plane displacements with applied load, measurements of geometrical and material imperfections, and results of subsidiary tests to determine the full plastic moment and squash load. A preliminary assessment of present design rules for beam-columns is carried out.}

Very distinct in their morphological and physio-chemical characters, they can be considered as a stational pedoclimax. The neo-rankers have an acid and fulvic moder and are more rich in iron, aluminium and silica, than the paleo-rankers having a humic and less acid moder. The humic fraction does not contain any lignin core and contains more aluminium, iron and magnesium than humines even though the latter has a higher ash ratio.

abstract = {An in vitro flow cytometric (FCM) DNA repair assay has been developed and validated by comparison to conventional autoradiography (ARG). Both assays measure unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS). Cultures of hepatocytes from young male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to a battery of 26 chemicals plus bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) or 3H-thymidine (3H-dT) for 18–20 h before harvest. Selection of test chemicals was based upon both their genotoxicity classifications and carcinogenicity bioassay results in male rats. DNA repair in chemically treated cultures was detected flow cytometrically by measuring the uptake of BrdUrd in non-replicating (G1, G2, mitotic and 4C) cells. Intracellular levels of incorporated BrdUrd were visualized by immunochemical labeling with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), and total cellular DNA content was simultaneously estimated by counterstaining samples with the nucleic acid intercalator, propidium iodide (PI). Information was obtained from 104 cells/sample. Since repairing cells incorporate significantly less BrdUrd per unit of time than replicating cells, low intensity BrdUrd-FITC fluorescent signals from repairing cells are readily discriminated from high intensity signals from replicating cells when displayed on linear univariate histograms. Further distinction between repairing and replicating cells was achieved by displaying the DNA contents of all cells on linear bivariate histograms. Thus, repairing cells were resolved without subjecting these cultures to agents which suppress replicative synthesis (e.g, hydroxyurea). Results from these concurrent FCM and ARG investigations include the following: (1) conclusions (DNA repair positive or negative) were in agreement, with one exception, cinnamyl anthranilate, for which cytotoxic doses produced a positive FCM response, but lack of intact hepatocytes in parallel ARG preparations prevented analysis; (2) similar sensitivities for most of the positive chemicals were reported; (3) a high correlation (85%) exists between the reported genotoxicity classification and these DNA repair results in the absence of overt cytotoxicity; (4) a poor correlation exists between these DNA repair results and hepatocarcinogenesis (only 4/11 liver carcinogens tested positive) or overall carcinogenesis in the male rat (only 9/21 carcinogens tested positive). This FCM assay provides a rapid, sensitive, safe and reliable means of identifying agents which induce DNA repair in mammalian cells.}

abstract = {The emissions of biacetyl after pulsed dye-laser excitation were studied at pressures down to 0.05 mtorr. At all energies the time-resolved fluorescence was composed of a nanosecond and a microsecond component. At “zero” pressure the long lived phosphorescence was absent while the “hot” phosphorescence has the same time characteristics as the slow fluorescence. By increasing the pressure the slow fluorescence was quenched while the milisecond phosphorescence was induced. We determined the low-pressure emission characteristics and the pressure effects as a function of excitation energy. From our data we obtained the parameters describing the intermediate type singlet-triplet coupling, the radiative and non-radiative relaxation rates from the singlet and triplet levels and the cross sections for the slow fluorescence quenching, all as a function of energy. Strong evidence is obtained for the participation of rotational states in the intra-molecular relaxation. The important difference between the situation where the singlet levels are isolated (low energy) and where the singlet level widths overlap (at higher energies) is demonstrated. In the former situation very large fluorescence quenching cross sectios were found. It is further shown that for high energies at least two effective collisions are needed to obtain a thermalized triplet; the mean energy removed per effective collision is 2200 cm−1.}

In 10 animals the eye pressure was not interfered with; in 5 the eye pressure was stabilized at about 22 mmHg using reservoirs. [131I]Albumin was used to determine the net formation of aqueous humor in one eye; [125I]albumin was used in the other eye. The average net rate of aqueous formation in the treated eyes and that in the controls were the same 1·61 ± 0·14 μl/min. The rate of flow into the general circulation was 0·34 ± 0·10 μl/min less in the treated eyes than in the controls. The uveo-scleral drainage was enhanced in the treated eyes. The facility of outflow was 0·35 ± 0·07 μl. min−1. mmHg−1 higher in the treated eyes than in the controls. There was little effect on pseudofacility, probably due to a high arterial blood pressure caused by absorption of the drug. Epinephrine tended to raise the recipient venous pressure. It is suggested that epinephrine has a facility reducing effect that is due to relaxation of the ciliary muscle and a facility increasing effect that may be due to some change in the endothelium of the canal of Schlemm. Since epinephrine has several antagonistic effects the effect on the intraocular pressure can be expected to vary even qualitatively.}

The relationship between migration and unemployment duration is examined. Standard job predictors of spell length (replacement income, labor force experience, personal characteristics and economic conditions) are included as control variables alongside measures of migration in a Weibull hazard model. The model is estimated using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Young adults who migrated while unemployed had longer durations of unemployment than those who did not migrate. The rate at which they found jobs was also linked to how long they had been unemployed, to being laid off, being African American, to going to college, having a mortgage and of national unemployment conditions.}

abstract = {Objectives. The aim of this study was to determine whether esmolol, an ultrashort-acting beta-adrenergic antagonist, possesses cardioprotective properties unrelated to a concomitant decrease in heart rate. Background. Previous studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with unchanged heart rates. Methods. The effect of esmolol (100 μg/kg per min) on the response of global cardiovascular and regional myocardial contractile function (sonomicrometry) to pacing-induced tachycardia and acute left ventricular afterloading was assessed in dogs with a critical stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). These responses were observed at the baseline hemoglobin level (12.5 ± 0.3 g/100 ml) as well as after hemodilution-induced mild regional contractile dysfunction (7.4 ± 0.4 g/100 ml) in the area supplied by this artery (LAD area). Data were analyzed by using a repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance with complete block design treating pacing rate and afterloading, respectively, as the repeated measure. Results. Esmolol decreased the maximal first derivative of left ventricular pressure (dP/dtmax); global cardiovascular and regional myocardial contractile function were otherwise unchanged. Esmolol did not alter the response of global cardiovascular or regional myocardial function to pacing-induced tachycardia or to acute left ventricular afterloading, both at the baseline hemoglobin level as well as during mild hemodilution-induced LAD area contractile dysfunction. Conclusions. At an infusion rate of 100 μg/kg per min we were unable to demonstrate cardioprotective esmolol effects in a canine model of critical coronary stenosis with controlled heart rate and identical loading conditions.}

Observations obtained in May and June 1986 show a predominantly along-isobath directed sub-tidal current. In the vertical cross-isobath plane a quasi-permanent upwelling zone overlying the steepest bottom slope is inferred from observed cross-isobath currents. In the same area Creutzberg (1985) observed a persistent chlorophyll a (chl a) maximum. Our observations show a chl a maximum extending from the bottom towards the pycnocline over a larger area in cross-isobath direction and with larger amounts of chl a than found by Creutzberg (1985). This chl a maximum is found above a zone of large amounts of benthic particulate organic carbon. The observed chl a distributions are compared with current and density observations via an advection-diffusion equation. Only rough estimates of the terms in this equation are obtained, which indicates that a balance between vertical advection and mixing, i.e. local generation, is most probable. The chl a distribution gives no evidence for an upwelling zone.}

abstract = {Side-scan sonar and subbottom profiling, coupled with bottom control through diving and sampling, have revealed new seafloor features in the northern Adriatic Sea and contributed to a better understanding of previously researched morphological and sedimentological features. Reef rock was found to be more significant than the previously known submerged beachrock exposures. Calcareous algae, madreporaria, bryozoa and serpulidae are the dominant reef builders. Single exposures of organic rock protruding above the seafloor range in size from a few cubic decimeters to several hundred thousand cubic meters. Such reefs have been tentatively divided into three types: (a) reef “sensu strictu” where organisms have built the entire feature; (b) cap reef, where the reef rock represents only a hard cap over a sedimentary core; and (c) coating reef, where the organic rock represents a thin coating over other rock types (mainly beachrock). Subbottom reflections both under and within features which at the surface appear to be reefs, confirm the existence of (b). Large beachrock exposures have been found between Lignano and Grado. In at least one case, beachrock seems to have supported reef growth. Other calcareous sandstones have been found in the area, but their thickness coupled with the absence of sedimentary structures and shell remains make it questionable whether the rock should be regarded as beachrock. A discontinuous, dense mattress of dead Posidonia roots has been found covering a large area (ca. 5 by 30 km) northeast of Venice in water depths ranging from 15 to 23 m. Such Posidonia mats are usually covered by a few centimeters of sand and have been cut and eroded by wave-induced turbulence to form “terraces” and a generally irregular bottom morphology. Mattresses of Posidonia roots form a protective cover along the crests of sandwaves south of Caorle in 20 m of water and protect them from wave erosion. Periodic lineations of very coarse sediment spaced 15 to 20 m apart on an otherwise fine, sandy bottom, have been found 20 miles east of Venice in 29 m of water. These are the result of sediment sorting due to exceptional storm waves coming from a southeasterly direction.}

Individuals spent from 84–97% of their diurnal time swimming, feeding, and hovering. Additionally, large adults spent a significant amount of time sheltering among crevices. Phase-related differences in these activities are statistically significant, as are differences in duration and rates of change of the activities. Large individuals spent more time swimming, while small individuals spent more time hovering. In addition, large individuals performed longer bouts of activity and switched activities less frequently than small individuals. Adult males and females spent approximately equal proportions of time in each of the activity states. Stochastic analyses of behavioural sequences show second order Markov chain dependencies, suggesting that preceding activity states affect subsequent behaviour. Possible relationships between behavioural sequencing and the species foraging strategy are discussed, and it is suggested that the sequence of behavioural activities can provide an estimation of the distribution of food resources in the environment.}

This chapter discusses the biochemical events related to phagocytosing cells. Phagocytosing cells include the polymorphonuclear leukocytes or neutrophils, the mononuclear leukocytes that can give rise to macrophages in tissues, and the eosinophils. Neutrophils are the most abundant phagocytes that ensure the early tissue response to infection. A decrease or increase in a number of leukocyte enzyme activities can be demonstrated in pathological situations, but the specificity of such changes and the way in which enzymes are brought about are not elucidated. The metabolic pathways are studied as multienzyme systems or by characterizing their individual enzymes. The enzymatic equipment of the polymorphonuclear cell is complete and the main metabolic pathways are present in white cells. Biochemical disorders in leukocytes may present a picture of metabolic impairment of the white cells themselves or that of general pathological manifestations in the human organism (Fl). Therefore, leukocytes have become a valuable tool for the study or even the diagnosis of inborn errors and acquired deficiencies and disorders of ubiquitous enzymes and metabolic systems because it can be isolated and purified with relative ease.}

abstract = {Uptake and efflux of 86Rb by lenses subjected to damage of varying degree have been investigated. Incisions were made through the capsule, anteriorly or posteriorly, with a pointed scalpel. Small incisions did not disturb either uptake or efflux when compared with intact lenses. More severe damage led to impaired efficiency in accumulation and intereased efflux, but additional changes could be superimposed in the presence of ouabain. An isolated preparation of anterior capsule plus epithelium was used in an attempt to differentiate between the ion transporting capabilities of the epithelium and of the fibres. 86Rb could not be concentrated across this membrane and it was concluded that it was excessively leaky, due to the isolation procedure, although ion movements were susceptible to ouabain. Evidence is presented that the fibres are capable of controlling, by means of a sodium pump, their own internal ionic content, but only to the extent that they are protected from the large ionic differential presented in the aqueous humour by the considerably greater pumping capacity of the epithelium.}

Accordingly, we describe the design and function of a knowledge-based system that is intended to support the initial stages of decision making in diagnosis of reading and spelling problems: (a) specifying the child's task performance in concrete behavioral terms, (b) identifying behavioral syndromes in these learning behaviors, and (c) generating candidate explanations, or diagnostic hypotheses, for these behaviors and syndromes. The systematic and formal foundation of the description of learning-behavior problems required for accomplishing these stages is provided by the facet definition approach. We present a mapping sentence that serves to define reading and spelling problems and that at the same time is used as a vehicle for communication between user and system. In order to show the latter function of the facet definition in the user interface of the system, a prototypical implementation of the system is described. Finally, some problems in constructing the required knowledge bases are discussed.}

The proximal portion of the root is associated with a sheet of dense material. All species have ‘9+2’ flagellar axonemes, with basal bodies composed of triplets of microtubules, but axonemal outer dynein arms appear to be absent. All have a cylinder at the base of the transition zone. The transition zone of Mastigamoeba punctachora is elongate and also contains a column of electron-dense material. Ultrastructural data are compiled and analysed to assess two alternative views that the pelobionts are a primitive group of eukaryotes and the source of the other eukaryotes, or that they are related to eumycetozoan slime moulds.}

Nitrogen inputs to the river were measured on days in May to October of 1977-81. These data indicated that about 38% of the daily nitrate input entered the river through ground water. The magnitude of this input is a consequence of widespread contamination of the shallow aquifer by nitrogen fertilizer. Ground water entering the river from springs and seeps near fertilized fields frequently contained more than 10 mg 1−1 of NO3-N. Mass balance studies of nitrogen transport in the river revealed an average daily nitraof 46 ± 23 kg N. This rate of nitrate removal represented about 40% of the ground water input to the river from the sand plain. Analysis of a mass balance for total Kjeldahl nitrogen revealed an essentially balanced budget, whereas chloride showed a small daily gain of about 5%. Laboratory experiments involving the incubation of stream sediment cores and the use of the acetylene block technique suggested that the bulk of the nitrate loss during river transport was caused by denitrification in bottom sediments.}

This resulted into both human and financial losses at all IoT levels especially individual and organization levels. Recently, cyber-criminals have kept on leveraging new skills and capabilities by conducting anti-forensics activities and employing techniques and tools to cover their tracks to evade any possible detection of the attack’s events, which has targeted either the IoT system or/and its component(s). Consequently, IoT cyber-attacks are becoming more efficient and more sophisticated with higher risks and threat levels based on their more frequent likelihood to occur and their impact. However, traditional security and forensics solutions are no longer enough to prevent nor investigate such cyber attacks, especially in terms of acquiring evidence for attack investigation. Hence, the need for well-defined, sophisticated, and advanced forensics investigation techniques is highly required to prevent anti-forensics techniques and track down cyber criminals. This paper reviews the different forensics and anti-forensics methods that can be applied in the IoT domain including tools, techniques, types, and challenges, while also discussing the rise of the anti-anti-forensics as a new forensics protection mechanism against anti-forensics activities. This would help forensics investigators to better understand the different anti-forensics tools, methods and techniques that cyber criminals employ while launching their attacks. Moreover, the limitations of the current forensics techniques are discussed, especially in terms of issues and challenges. Finally, this paper presents a holistic view from a literature point of view over the forensics domain in general and for IoT in particular.}

This chapter discusses the theory of electromechanical devices, as well as various practical applications. Electromechanical devices convert electrical energy to mechanical energy. Electromechanical devices consist of three subsystems: the electrical drive circuitry, an electromechanical coupling subsystem, and a mechanical subsystem. Electromechanical devices are governed by a coupled system of electrical and mechanical equations. The electrical equations follow from quasi-static field theory, and the mechanical equations follow from Newton's laws. Furthermore, the chapter derives equations of motion for electromechanical devices that execute either linear or rotational motion. These equations are applied to the analysis of various practical devices including magnetic circuit actuators, linear, rotational and resonant actuators, axial-field motors, and stepper motors. The focus is on magnetically linear, singly excited (single pair of electrical terminals), electromechanical devices with a single degree of mechanical freedom.}

As a logical consequence of the definition of a bacterium (Stanier and van Niel, 1962), R. Y. Stanier created the name «cyanobacteria as a replacement for «blue-green algae. As such, cyanobacteria entered the 8th issue of Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology 1974 as members of the Procaryotae Murray 1968, this kingdom being composed of two divisions, Cyanobacteria and Bacteria. An even tighter integration of cyanobacteria with other bacteria was proposed by Gibbons and Murray (1978) for the next edition of Bergey's Manual. These authors suggested that the cyanobacteria be integrated as an order Cyanobacteriales in the class Photobacteria. However, this proposal was doomed to failure by constrants imposed under present rules of the Bacteriological Code (Lapage et al., 1976), one of which is that the type of an order is the genus upon whose name the higher taxon is based. A genus Cyanobacterium did not exist when Gibbons and Murray made their proposal, and a subsequent special request by the same authors for an exemption from this rule was not granted (Judicial Commission of the International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology, Holt, 1978). We present here a revised classification for unicellular cyanobacteria dividing in one plane wherein we propose, among other changes, the creation of two new genera, Cyanobium and Cyanobaceterium. With the creation of the latter genus, the requirement for recognition of cyanobacteria as a legal order Cyanobacteriales under the Bacteriological Code should be fulfilled. We suggest that the type species of this genus be Cyanobacterium stanieri, in honor of the late Roger Y. Stanier.
Résumé
La définition d'une «bactérie proposée par Stanier et van Niel en 1962 [48] a eu pour conséquence logique la création, par R. Y. Stanier, du nom «cyanobactéries pour remplacer celui d' «algues bleues. C'est sous cette dénomination que ces organismes entrèrent dans la troisième édition du manuel de détermination bactériologique de Bergey en 1974 [4]. Dans ce manuel, les cyanobactéries étaient traitées comme membres des Procaryotae Murray 1968, cet embranchement étant constitué par deux groupes: les Cyanobactéries et les Bactéries. Un rapproachement encore plus étroit des cyanobactéries des autres bactéries a été proposé par Gibbons et Murray [16] pour la prochaine édition du manuel de Bergey. Ces auteurs ont proposé que les cyanobactéries soient intégrées dans la classe des Photobactéries, en tant qu'ordre des Cyanobacteriales. Cette proposition fut refusée comme ne satisfaisant pas les règles du Code Bactériologigue [28], l'une de ces règles étant que le type d'un ordre est le genre sous le nom duquel le taxon d'ordre plus élevé est basé. Le genre Cyanobacterium n'existait pas lorsque Gibbons et Murray ont fait leur proposition, et une demande ultérieure d'exception à cette règle [17] fut également refusée. Nous proposons ici une nouvelle classification des cyanobactéries unicellulaires qui se divisent sur un seul plan. Entre autres changements, nous proposons la création de deux nouveaux genres: Cyanobium et Cyanobacterium. La création de ce dernier genre devrait lever l'objection qui empêchait de reconnaître les Cyanobacteriales comme ordre légitime suivant les règles du Code Bactériologique. Nous proposons que l'espèce type de ce genre soit appelée Cyanobacterium stanieri pour honorer la mémoire de Roger Y. Stanier.}

Two constitutive hydrogenases and photosynthesis are insensitive to metronidazole at these same concentrations. At higher concentrations metronidazole inhibits photosynthesis in Anabaena while photoreduction and to a lesser extent photohydrogen production are retarded in Scenedesmus. Respiration is slightly stimulated at high metronidazole levels in both algae. The reductant source for nitrogenase in Anabaena and photohydrogen production and photoreduction electron transport in Scenedesmus are discussed. Due to the activity of metronidazole as a selective inhibitor of ferredoxin-associated processes, it should prove to be useful in N2 fixation studies and in distinguishing between ferredoxin-linked reactions of different sensitivities and other activities not associated with low reduction potential components.}

abstract = {The geochemistry of the REE (rare earth elements) in oceanic sediments is discussed, based mainly on samples from DSDP Holes 530A and 530B, Leg 75, and Hole 525A, Leg 74. The proposed mechanisms for incorporation of the REE into the marine carbonate phases are adsorption, chiefly onto the carbonate minerals and on Sc, Hf, and Ta-rich Fe-Mn hydroxide flocs as carbonate coatings. The Ce anomaly of marine carbonate was used as an indicator of paleo-ocean water redox conditions: the bottom water of the Angola Basin was in a reducing condition in the Cretaceous. At ca. 54 My, the South Atlantic water condition became oxidizing, similar to the present seawater redox condition. This change was related to the improvement of circulation due to the widening of South Atlantic and the subsidence of water circulation barriers such as the Walvis Ridge and perhaps the Romanche Fracture Zone. The younger (Eocene-Recent) and older (Albian-Santonian) argillaceous sedimentary rocks from 530A (denoted as YSAB and OSAB respectively) show different degrees of Eu depletion with a transition period in between. The REE patterns of OSAB suggest a basaltic origin. The possible sources are Kaoko basalt in Southwest Africa or Namibia and the basaltic Walvis Ridge itself. The decrease in the area covered by Kaoko basalt due to erosion, the subsidence of the Walvis Ridge, and the improvement of water circulation led to changes in the Eu anomaly from Campanian to Paleocene, and resulted in the YSAB REE pattern. Changes in the Sm/Eu, La/Th, Th/Yb, Ti/Al2O3, FeO/Al2O3, and Hf/Al2O3 ratios suggest changes of average source rock composition from and esite to granodiorite. The REE abundances and patterns of younger sediments in the Angola Basin (YSAB) are very similar to those observed in NASC, PAAS, and ES sediments. The YSAB REE abundances and patterns may represent the average REE distribution of the exposed African continental crust. The strong resemblance of REE distributions of YSAB, NASC, PAAS and ES suggests thorough REE mixing from different sources and the uniformity of the average crustal compositions of different continents: Africa, North America, Australia, and Europe}

We prove that for a large class of topological -algebras the normality of the wedge of positive elements is necessary and sufficient for a topological -algebra to be algebraically and topologically isomorphic to a -algebra of unbounded operators equipped with the uniform topology. From this theorem we obtain some corollaries, so for instance, well-known results of Lassner, Brooks and Grothendieck.}

The cause of renal artery disease was fibrous dysplasia in 53 patients, Takayasu’s arteritis in 2 or an arterial aneurysm in 1. Bilateral or branch renal artery disease, and extrarenal arterial disease were present in 16, 23 and 11 patients, respectively. The results of 28 patients treated from 1955 to 1977 (group 1) were compared to those of 28 patients treated from 1978 to 1988 (group 2). Hypertension was cured or improved postoperatively in 83% of the patients from group 1 and in 96% from group 2 (p = 0.07). However, this outcome was achieved through surgical revascularization in only 48% of the patients from group 1 compared to 96% from group 2 (p = 0.0002). A multivariate analysis revealed that the only significant variable related to clinical outcome was the era of treatment, which reflects the improved technical efficacy of revascularization during the last decade. Aortorenal bypass and renal autotransplantation have emerged as the preferred revascularization operations. It currently is possible to achieve amelioration of hypertension and preservation of renal function in most young patients with renal artery disease.}

abstract = {It is difficult to obtain a balanced and accurate picture of medieval views of such topics as childhood, treatment of children, and the nature of family ties, whether of affection or obligation. A significant source of information on these topics, abundant but so far underused, lies in the sermons, pastoral handbooks and biblical commentaries of the period. These are abundant for the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries, allowing the historian to examine the development of ideas over time. One group of late thirteenth century ad status collections, written by friars, is particularly interesting. They were extremely popular throughout the fourteenth century, and therefore represent an important starting point for any study of developing views about the young. Comparison of their views with those of their predecessors, identifies a clear trend towards increased awareness of children as a group with specific characteristics and specific needs. Overall, the writers of these late thirteenth century ad status collections - John of Wales, Guibert de Tournai, Humbert de Romans - show decided reservations about the value of corporal punishment, and a conviction that children are intrinsically good, despite the sins characteristic of their various stages of development. This must call into question some of the conclusions reached by scholars such as Philippe Ariès and Lloyd de Mause.}

The method involves packing the column with dry gel and developing it in solvent mixtures used for thin-layer chromatography of the same lipids. Solvent is allowed to migrate only to the end of the column; access to the bands of separated material is obtained by using columns with a removable glass front. RF values of lipids on development columns and those on thin-layer plates are nearly identical when the column is packed with thin-layer chromatography gel. Such columns, however, develop very slowly. Columns packed with fine silica gel designed for elution column chromatography develop very rapidly and yield separations that are still quite comparable to those obtainable from thin-layer plates. Such columns are convenient for the purification of phospholipids in amounts of 10 mg to about 10 g. Column design and construction are described in detail.}

abstract = {Adult mites from a wild population were exposed to humidity gradients in small tubes at 20, 25, and 30°C. The humidity response was found to be almost entirely due to the steepness of the gradient in evaporation rate and essentially the same in all parts of the range. There is evidence of a negative influence of the higher humidity, but this is definitely of minor importance. The receptor is considered to be an evaporating organ and the possible mechanisms for this type are discussed: osmoreceptors, mechanoreceptors, and thermoreceptors. The similarity between the responses of the mites and of thermoreceptors to rate of change of the stimulus as well as to a constant stimulus makes close comparison possible. It is shown that an evaporating receptor of a size small enough for this mite would be cooled sufficiently to stimulate thermoreceptors and that the rate of water loss would not be too great.}

This publication describes a technique called EmoCNN, which uses deep learning techniques to precisely identify and classify human emotions, emphasizing improving model performance using different optimizers. Our research intends to contribute to the creation of more effective systems that improve computer-human interaction by solving the problems associated with emotion recognition. By bridging the gap between humans and robots, accurate emotion detection enables systems to perceive emotions for customized and responsive interactions. AI-powered assistants, chatbots, and social robots all benefit from emotion recognition by providing more responsive, empathic and interesting user experiences. Emotion-aware technologies can also enhance user feedback analysis, human-centered design, and monitoring of mental health. Using a human emotion detection dataset, we carried out comprehensive experiments focusing on the happy, sad, and neutral emotion classes. Constructing a customized EmoCNN model with convolutional layers, a hidden layer, ReLU activation, and max-pooling was the focus of our computational work. We investigated various optimizers and evaluated how they affected accuracy, convergence speed and loss minimization. The results demonstrated that the EmoCNN model, which had been trained using the Adam optimizer, gave the best accuracy in distinguishing between emotions. Our paper provides a comparative analysis, highlighting the superiority of EmoCNN over existing models, showcasing its ability to achieve higher validation accuracy (89%) and more efficient emotion recognition when compared to previous approaches with minimal loss. Our research advances the field of emotional computing by demonstrating how well EmoCNN can identify and categorizes various human emotions. This discovery has significant ramifications for the creation of emotion-aware computers, which can better understand and react to human emotions, enhancing computer-human interaction.}

abstract = {A biophysically based distributed parameter ecohydrological catchment model, TOPOG_IRM, is described which predicts the dynamic interactions between soil-vegetation-atmosphere systems over a catchment. The physiological control on transpiration is formulated using canopy resistance defined as a function of the net assimilation rate, the relative humidity and CO2 concentration at the leaf surface. Rainfall infiltration, runoff and redistribution are simulated with the Richards equation and evapotranspiration is calculated using the Penman-Monteith equation. Two innovative features of the model are (1) coupling of the vegetation-atmosphere system by changing the value of the vapour pressure deficit of air in the canopy, and (2) the plant carbon balance, which allows the simulation of plant growth using a saturation rate kinetics formulation. The model was validated using evapotranspiration, soil moisture and leaf area index measurements from Wagga Wagga, N.S.W., Australia, for a period of 1992–1993. The calculated evapotranspiration was in good agreement with the observations. The soil moisture content at various depths was well simulated for two typical sites. The model also reasonably reproduced leaf area index of wheat and canola for two growing seasons. The success of the model simulations was due to the reasonably realistic treatment of the soil and canopy processes. The sensitivity analysis indicated that (1) the maximum assimilation rate of carbon affects canopy transpiration significantly, and (2) the total drainage is sensitive to the lower boundary conditions and the saturated hydraulic conductivity. TOPOG_IRM is a valuable tool in studying catchment responses under different land management practices. However, the application of the model is limited by the large amount of data required regarding soil and vegetation properties, and their spatial distribution.}

The core fractions reveal two different rod—core linker polypeptides LRC29.5PC and LRC32PC and one rod linker LR31PC associating the first and the following “trimeric” PC complexes at the profile sides of the core. The “minimal” phycobilisome type with an apparent molecular weight Mr of 4 500 000 is characterized by the occurrence of only one additional rod linker polypeptide LR34.5PC. Further sequential elongation of the rods occurs by PC and phycoerythrocyanin (PEC) “trimers” in cooperation with two low molecular weight linker polypeptides LR11PC and LR11PEC. The structure of the “maximal” phycobilisome with Mr 8 500 000 is completed by the association of PEC “hexamers” via LR34.5PEC. This sequential assembly could be demonstrated by the polypeptide composition of different “intermediate” and “maximal” phycobilisomes. The large number of linker polypeptides and the stoichiometric calculations of core fractions and of different phycobilisome “types” indicate a partial “trimeric” organization of the rod complexes. With respect to polypeptide stoichiometry, the “trimeric” arrangement of PC·LRC29.5/32, PC·LR31, PC·LR11 and PEC·LR11 in the structure of the rods is proposed. The structural and functional consequences of the study are represented in a model of the “maximal” phycobilisome.}

This methodology is based on the formulation and development of a rigorous model in comparison with those commonly used in batch distillation. The resulting set of differential-algebraic equations (DAE) is solved using an efficient numerical strategy based on Gear's method, which is especially adapted to deal with DAE systems and numerical features arising in the batch context. Numerical difficulties due to detection of time and state events, the occurrence of discontinuities and start-up policy schemes (involving chemical reactions or not) are emphasized. Original and interesting solutions are proposed to tackle each of these problems. Finally, the flexibility, reliability and efficiency of the proposed methodology are illustrated through academic and industrial case studies, the results of which are compared with plant data.}

Sediment in the southern Ross Sea accumulates at rates ranging from ≤0.6 to 2.7 mm/y, with the highest values occurring in the southwestern Ross Sea. Biogenic-silica content in surface sediments ranges from 2% (by weight) in Sulzberger Bay and the eastern Ross Sea to 41% in the southwestern Ross Sea. Biogenic-silica accumulation in the southwestern Ross Sea averages 2.7 × 10−2 g/cm2/y and is comparable to accumulation rates in high-productivity, upwelling environments from low-latitude continental margins (e.g., Gulf of California, coast of Peru). The total rate of biogenic-silica accumulation in the southern Ross Sea is approximately 0.2 × 1014 g/y, with most of the accumulation occurring in basins (500–1000 m water depth). If biogenic-silica accumulation in the southern Ross Sea continental shelf is typical of other basins on the Antarctic continental shelf, as much as 1.2 × 1014 g/y of silica could be accumulating in these deposits.

In denervated eyes the intraocular pressure stayed at the same level as in normal eyes when the same amount of drug was injected, while the gross facility was significantly different. These results suggest that there is an increase in secretion together with an increase in gross facility. Test series in which gross facilities were measured at different pressure differentials, suggested that low facilities resulted from high pressure differentials and vice versa. In those experiments where the reservoir pressure was kept constant at 16 mmHg above P0 for some 20 min, the gross facility increased by some 50%. The results suggest that the law ΔF = C. ΔP, which gives a constant value of C in a fixed system of tubes, cannot be applied to the living monkey eye.}

Also, a new model of computing that is noteworthy today is mobile cloud computing (MCC) that is used to reduce the limitations of mobile devices by allowing them to offload certain computations to the remote cloud. The cloud environment may consist of critical or essential information of an organization; therefore, to prevent this environment from possible attacks a security solution is needed. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a solution to these security issues. An IDS is a hardware or software device that can examine all inside and outside network activities and recognize doubtful patterns that may demonstrate a network attack and automatically alert the network (or system) administrator. Because of the ability of an IDS to detect known/unknown (inside/outside) attacks, it is an excellent choice for securing cloud computing. Various methods are used in an intrusion detection system to recognize attacks more accurately. Unlike survey papers presented so far, this paper aims to present a comprehensive survey of intrusion detection systems that use computational intelligence (CI) methods in a (mobile) cloud environment. We firstly provide an overview of CC and MCC paradigms and service models, also reviewing security threats in these contexts. Previous literature is critically surveyed, highlighting the advantages and limitations of previous work. Then we define a taxonomy for IDS and classify CI-based techniques into single and hybrid methods. Finally, we highlight open issues and future directions for research on this topic.}

The fractionation was monitored employing synthetic substrates for assaying both antithrombin (with H-D-Phe-Pip-Arg-pNA ; S-2238) and anti-FXa (with Bz-Ileu-Glu-Gly-Arg-pNA ; S-2222) activities. The resulting fractions were evaluated in different amidolytic and coagulation methods used to determine heparin potency by comparison with PSH. By gel filtration of PSH on Ultrogel AcA 54, both strong anti-FXa and antithrombin activities were associated with the fractions eluted in the high molecular weight range (MW ⋍ 20 × 103). These fractions also had potent anticoagulant action when assayed by conventional clotting methods. PSH was also subjected to fractionation by an ion-exchange technique (DEAE-Sephacel) with increasing salt molarity. The patterns for antithrombin and anti-FXa activities were again closely related, if not identical. Four fractions were usually distinguished, with respectively negligible, intermediate, high and very high activities when compared to PSH. The very highly active fraction (HAF), approximately 15% by weight, was eluted at high salt molarity (> 0.8 M NaCl). On a weight basis its anticoagulant activity was ⋍ 2–3 times that of PSH as determined by amidolytic as well as clotting methods. Intravenous injection of HAF to rabbits and dogs (1.0 and 2.5 mg/kg) produced a much stronger anticoagulant response than PSH, also showing an effect which persisted for a longer duration.}

The finite element library of SUPERB contains isoparametric plane stress, plane strain, flat plate, curved shell, solid type curved shell and solid elements in addition to conventional beam and spring elements. Linear, quadratic and cubic interpolation functions are available for all isoparametric elements. Independent parameters such as displacements and temperatures are obtained from SUPERB using the stiffness method of analysis. The remaining dependent parameters, such as stresses and strains, are evaluated at element gauss points and extrapolated to nodal locations. Averaged values are given as final output. The graphic capabilities of SUPERB consists of geometry and distorted geometry plotting, and stress, strain and temperature contouring. Contours are plotted at user defined cutting planes for solids and at top, middle or bottom surfaces for plate and shell types of structures. In the first part of this paper, the program capabilities of SUPERB are summarized. Extrapolation techniques used for determining dependent nodal parameters and for contour plotting are explained in the second part of the paper. Behavior of standard, wedge and transition type isoparametric elements and the effect of interpolation function orders on accuracy are discussed in the third part. The results of several illustrative problems are included.}

For an at-grade situation, field experiments have revealed that mechanical mixing dominates effects due to ambient stability, that plume rise is important under very low crossroad winds, that regions of large shear enhance the mixing volume, and that the wake region grows rather slowly in the vertical direction. The models that have been developed based on recent experimental results are briefly described. For the street canyon situation, both field and wind tunnel experiments have revealed that ambient stability does not play an important role, that corner vortices near an intersection cause an increase in pollutant concentrations near the bottom corners of the leeside buildings, that in the midsection of a street block the vortex circulation causes high pollutant concentrations to be advected toward and up the leeside wall. No general street canyon models are available except an empirical model for the midsection of the street block. The complicated flow field must first be ascertained before a reliable concentration model can be developed.}

Viral DNA replication is almost completely blocked when the drug is added earlier than 4 hr postinfection in concentrations between 50 and 150 μM. Replication of viral DNA in all four size-classes (>100 S, 50–90 S, 34 S, and <20 S) is inhibited. The replication block is reversible upon withdrawal of the inhibitor. When DRB is administered at the time of maximal viral DNA replication, 16–18 hr postinfection, the inhibitor has no apparent effect on viral DNA synthesis. In the presence of 150 μM DRB, synthesis of early virus-specific RNA in the nucleus is reduced by approximately 90% and the appearance of virus-specific RNA sequences in the cytoplasm is reduced by >95%, as demonstrated by DNA-RNA filter hybridization. Thus, the block in viral DNA replication is best explained by the inhibition of the synthesis of early virus-specific RNA.}

abstract = {Publisher Summary
The ability of microorganisms to adhere to surfaces has significant implications for food science. Microorganisms attached to plant and animal tissues can affect food safety and spoilage. Microorganisms can adhere firmly and are therefore difficult to remove or inactivate without damaging the underlying tissue. This is not of concern for most processed foods, but it is for foods that are to be sold as raw or minimally processed. Disease outbreaks associated with Salmonella on chicken and fresh produce and Escherichia coli 0157:H7 in apple juice, alfalfa seed sprouts, and lettuce may be related to the inability of sanitizer and washing treatments to remove or inactivate attachedpathogens. Microbial attachment to food contact surfaces is also of significance for food safety and spoilage. Microorganisms attached to processing equipment may escape cleaning and sanitizing procedures and proceed to contaminate processed product. Pathogens originating with raw products can attach to food preparation surfaces, which, if not adequately cleaned before reuse, can serve to recontaminate cooked foods. The ability to attach to and subsequently detach from surfaces is a characteristic of all microorganisms. Attachment is advantageous and perhaps necessary for survival in the natural environment, as it allows microorganisms to exert some control over their nutritional environment, and offers protection from environmental stresses. Attachment is also the initial event in microbial infections, for if a cell fails to adhere it will be carried away from its potential host. Therefore, microbial attachment is a process that has been extensively studied.}

Analysis of the progeny of backcrosses of the revertants to wild type, showed that 25 of the 28 revertants contained is lesions. This result indicated that 25 of the 28 revertants were suppressed pseudorevertants with the suppressor mutation in a gene that could be separated from the parental is lesion by recombination. The nature of the is lesion(s) was examined for a number of the is clones derived from back-crosses. In every case, except one, the parental is lesion was found. In five of the ten suppressed pseudorevertants examined, nonparental is lesions could also be rescued. Two of the nonparental is lesions were in the previously defined recombinant groups. Five of the nonparental is lesions represented a new recombination group or groups since they recombined with the prototype mutants of all of the defined recombination groups. Recombination analysis indicated that the five new mutants fall into two recombination groups for which we propose the designations H and I. The nonparental is lesions rescued from suppressed pseudorevertants may represent suppressor mutations with is phenotype. However, the majority of the suppressor mutations identified had no temperature phenotype and were identified only by their effect on the phenotype of the original is lesion. The fact that a large proportion of revertants were suppressed by extragenic suppressor mutations suggests that mutation events leading to extragenic suppression occur at a much higher frequency than do intragenic events leading to revertant phenotype. These results indicate a general mechanism by which RNA viruses can bypass the effects of deleterious mutations in the absence of intramolecular recombination.}

This research, conducted between 1951 and 1985, was mostly concentrated in East and Southern Africa, but a number of pollen sequences from intervening sites provide some links between the data of these two regions. In all this immense region, of half the African continent, information from fossil pollen is available only from some 30 sites. In addition to problems with absolute dating, the interpretation of the results in terms of former vegetation poses difficult questions. While it is far too early to draw detailed maps of former vegetation some very general conclusions can be inferred from the data presented. At two sites in East Africa pollen evidence has been found for the existence of a warmer and more humid period from ca. 32,000 to 28,000 yr B.P., an episode known as the Kalambo Interstadial. During the period from ca. 28,000 to 20,000 yr B.P. the climate in East and Central Africa was fairly similar to that during the Holocene moist period. In Southern Africa during the same period palynologic and geologic results indicate that cold episodes occurred while higher rainfall in East Africa, the Kalahari and adjacent regions caused high lake levels. During the last glacial maximum from ca. 20,000 to 16,000–14,000 yr B.P. aridity spread over nearly the whole region. The Zaire rain forest was considerably reduced and the tree line on the East African mountains was depressed by 900–1100 m, indicating a drop in mean temperature of 5–8°C. Lakes in East Africa and the Kalahari dried out, except for the southern Kalahari, its surroundings, and the SW Cape, where humidity was high. The general causes for aridity were the low evaporation at the ocean surface and the strong upwelling of colder waters. More humid conditions which have been postulated for the central part of southern AFrica could have been the result of lower evaporation in lake basins while the penetration of winter rainfall in the area has also been proposed. An abrupt change to warmer and more humid conditions in East Africa at ca. 12,000 yr B.P. reversed all the former processes. Rainfall also penetrated the Kalahari from the NW, NE and SW sides. Remarkable fluctuations in climate at this juncture could be demonstrated by pollen evidence in South Africa only at Aliwal North. During the Holocene, humid conditions persisted in East Africa until ca. 4000 yr B.P., when the climate became drier. Insufficient dated evidence in southern Africa makes it difficult to compare the various climate chronologies. In general the climate may have been wetter until about 4000 B.P. when a dry interval occurred. In East Africa pollen data point to deforestation by man during the last two millennia.}

For NOKr and NOXe similar Maitland—Smith potentials are obtained by assuming the Pt anisotropy parameter for these systems to be equal to that for NOAr.

It is demonstrated that while a large component of the growth is due to technology related factors, these expenditures, and in particular, hardware spending, are sensitive to the growth rate of the economy and fluctuate around the technology-driven growth path due to general business conditions. The validity of the popular belief that software effort (including both software-development and maintenance) represents a growing proportion of information systems expenditures is tested versus the competing view that software effort and hardware expenditures consume relatively constant budget shares. It is shown that after controlling for macroeconomic effects, hardware and software expenditures grow exponentially at the same rate. The analysis also suggests that in the aggregate, it is primarily the hardware outlays that adjust in response to unexpected business conditions.}

It is argued that implicit rheological models are essential in this exercise and, accordingly, the numerical method of solution is forced to recognise the equations of continuity, the stress equations of motion and the rheological equations as separate equations involving velocity, pressure and stress variables with appropriate boundary conditions on these variables. The present paper is concerned with L-shaped and T-shaped geometries, and the effect of elasticity is assessed by comparing the numerical predictions for an elastic liquid with those for an inelastic liquid with the same “viscosity” behaviour. This comparison is facilitated by a simple limiting procedure outlined in Section 2. The main conclusions from the work are that, in general terms, elasticity works against inertia, reducing the pressure drop caused by the abrupt change in geometry and reducing the area of influence of the bend (for finite Reynolds numbers). So far as the stress fields are concerned most interest centres on the corner region, as one would expect, but there is also a region of normal-stress activity, which is generated by “stretching” rather than “shearing”. In an appendix, some consideration is given to the entry-length and exit-length problems. It is concluded that the overall problem is a complex one, since it depends to a large measure on the criterion one uses for “fully-developed” flow. If a fairly crude criterion is used, fluid elasticity is found to decrease the entry-length and increase the exit-length.}

Litter samples contained up to 52 species, of which one-third represented epiphytes, vines, and lianas. These modern leaf litter studies from southeast Amazonian Peru indicate that reconstructions of ancient high-diversity forests are possible using autochthonous leaf litter deposits. In comparison to temperate litter samples, however, more sampling must be done to recreate fairly simple descriptors of ancient communities such as species richness and heterogeneity. Samples must be large, relatively closely spaced, and maintained as distinct collecting localities to retrieve the maximum amount of data from rich, angiosperm-dominated localities. There are many advantages justifying more intensive collections. For example, biomass contribution of major life-form categories in the source forest is reflected in leaf litter accumulating under tropical forest canopies. Tropical forests, because of their extreme heterogeneity, also can provide the opportunity to reconstruct individual species characteristics from litter signatures. The relative rarity of most species creates distinct leaf shadows from which the canopy breadth and volume of many individuals can be estimated. The principles derived from modern tropical litter studies can be applied to existing fossil collections; however, their power lies with those collections originating from autochthonous assemblages, for which spatial control during collecting has been maintained, and time averaging has been kept to a minimum. These reflections of community structure available from the leaf litter provide a means for paleobiologists to contribute significantly to the study of community evolution and stability.}

The corpus cavernosum was supplied by the penile deep artery. It gave off branches to become either arteries distributed within the corpus cavernosum or those directly supplying the corpus spongiosum urethrae. The former arteries further divided into small arteries which fell into two categories: 1) arteries breaking up into capillaries, and 2) arteries draining directly into the cavernous sinuses. The capillaries were collected into venular networks just beneath the tunica albuginea (the subalbugineal venular plexus), while the cavernous sinuses were collected into venules at the periphery of the corpus cavernosum. These postcavernous venules also received venules from the subalbugineal venular plexus, and left the corpus cavernosum. Thus, two circulatory routes are evident within the corpus cavernosum. These findings suggested that the penile erectile cycle is controlled by hemodynamic changes between these two routes within the corpus cavernosum. (J. Urol, 142: 879–883, 1989)}

abstract = {Publisher Summary
The chapter discusses the most common vulnerabilities and configuration errors on routers and switches. Routers and switches perform the most fundamental actions on a network. They route and direct packets on a network and enable communications at the lowest layers. No penetration test is complete without including network devices. Before conducting a penetration test on a network device, one must first identify the device. The chapter discusses penetration testing a network device from two aspects: internal and external. The chapter presents a number of tools and techniques to be used in security level of a network device. The chapter primarily focuses on the tools included on the Auditor bootable CD, but where appropriate, other tools are also described, including Windows applications that are both commercial and open source. Different types of scanning tools and techniques are discussed that deal with network devices.}

abstract = {Calcareous stromatolites of the upper Siyeh Limestone (ca. 1.1 ∘ 109 years old) were studied in the central part of Glacier National Park, Montana. The stromatolites, mound- and dome-shaped structures deposited in a shallow, generally submerged, tidally influenced setting, were formed by a combination of in situ carbonate precipitation and organic stabilization of detrital material. Well-developed, 1–4 cm diameter, branched columns occur in a single stromatolite bed. Physical factors, including the size and shape of sediment-surface irregularities upon which the stromatolites developed, the rate of sedimentation between stromatolites, and the water depth, played a major role in controlling stromatolite macrostructure. Deposition of non-organically stabilized detritus on stromatolite growth surfaces inhibited the development of small-diameter columns by smoothing over developing growth features. Columnar structures are absent in stromatolites that contain abundant non-organically stabilized sediment. In contrast, they are well-developed in a stromatolite bed that is relatively deficient in such material. “Molar-tooth” structures are common in the impure dolomitic limestones, and the abundant sheet-shaped forms appear to be sparry-calcite-filled syneresis cracks.}

An intact glucose carrier system in the isolated membranes was demonstrated as evidenced by the following. (a) d-Glucose was taken up and released faster than l-glucose. (b) Sodium ions increased initial rate and extent of d-glucose uptake 3- to 5-fold; no other cation showed this effect. (c) d-Glucose uptake and release was inhibited by phlorizin. (d) Countertransport of d-glucose was demonstrated. (e) d- and l-glucose reached the same level of uptake after prolonged incubation. (f) Uptake of labeled d-glucose was inhibited by higher concentrations of unlabeled d-galactose and vice versa. Glucose uptake by membrane vesicles represented entry into an intravesicular aqueous space rather than binding to the membrane. Exposure of the membrane to increasing cellobiose concentrations led to osmotic shrinkage of the intravesicular space and decreased glucose uptake. Infinite medium osmolarity and therefore zero intravesicular space resulted in no glucose uptake. Sodium in the medium (but not in the intravesicular spaces) stimulated d-glucose transport. It is concluded that isolated brush border membranes of intestinal epithelial cells retain the glucose carrier system. The reported findings are consistent with the concept that (a) glucose transport across the brush border membrane represents “facilitated diffusion”; (b) the glucose carrier is dependent on sodium ions; and (c) high extracellular, but not intracellular sodium concentrations lead to increased glucose transport.}

Nitrate assimilation ceases completely when ammonium is added and recommences as soon as ammonium has disappeared. Ammonium does not inhibit nitrate reduction by cells unable to assimilate ammonium because they lack a carbon source. Thus the inhibition is not due to ammonium per se but is connected with its assimilation. The inhibition is not thought to result from competition for reduced pyridine nucleotide because nitrate reductase of Chlorella is specific for DPN while glutamic dehydrogenase is specific for TPN. Nitrite addition also inhibits nitrate assimilation completely but ammonium only partially inhibits nitrite assimilation.}

abstract = {This report summarizes current developments in the United States and 18 other industrial countries regarding packaging waste. It presents available data concerning the types, amounts, and methods of managing such waste and provides information concerning the policies established or under consideration to reduce the amount of such waste being disposed. The countries discussed are all members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In recent years, waste disposal capacity has become more scarce in most OECD countries. As a result, waste management policies have focused on efforts to reduce and recycle major components of the waste stream. Packaging represents about one-third of municipal solid waste in many countries. Because of this, measures to reduce the amount and toxicity of packaging and to encourage its recycling are currently being considered in at least 18 OECD countries. In addition, the EC and the Nordic Council are developing programs to address packaging on a regional basis. The report is divided into four main sections. Section I summarizes available information for the OECD countries. The second section discusses waste generation and recycling rates for six types of packaging material: paper, glass, metal, plastic, wood, and composites. The third section discusses key questions raised by the information presented in the report. The fourth briefly discusses packaging waste issues facing the Congress. In general, the report finds, other countries use less packaging than the United States, recycle more of it, and are considering policy measures stronger than the measures generally being considered in America. As noted in detail, other countries have adopted or are developing requirements that: &#x02022;• set mandatory requirements for packaging waste reduction;&#x02022;• require reusable or refillable packaging;&#x02022;• impose taxes to discourage single-use packages;&#x02022;• prohibit the use of non-recyclable packaging,&#x02022;• prohibit or limit disposal of packaging, and&#x02022;• require manufacturers of packaging materials to collect and recycle post-consumer waste. Perhaps the most fundamental issue raised by these approaches is whether local governments will continue to bear responsibility for funding and operating recycling programs or whether all or some of this responsibility might be shifted to industry. To date, this issue has not been joined in the Congress directly; however, there is a growing consensus in other countries concerning the advantages of industry responsibility.}

This chapter focuses on important client security aspects that include least privilege, Internet Explorer (IE) security, security changes in XP Service Pack 2, spyware protection, and the Trusted Platform Module (TPM). It also covers the upcoming client security features in Internet Explorer 7.0 and Windows Vista. The principle of least privilege means that you should a user or a piece of code is given only the privileges it needs to do the job. For administrators, this means that they should have two accounts in an AD domain—one low-privilege account, and another high privilege account. UNIX is the best example that completely follows the principle of least privilege. The tools that administrators and users can use today in Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, R2, and Windows XP to honor least privilege are RunAs, fast user switching, and third party tolls like dropmyrights and the privilege bar, The chapter also details the Windows XP Service Pack 2 security enhancements that include critical security enhancements for both users and developers. In Windows XP, Microsoft introduced a built-in personal firewall: the Internet Connection Firewall (ICF). XP SP2 offers more security resilience, that is, it increases the level of security and protection even on systems that don't have the latest security patches installed.’. The chapter also details the concept of browser security that highlights intelligent add-on management, pop-up blocking, and hidden IE security changes. Internet Explorer (IE) security zones are a powerful and often neglected security feature of Microsoft's Internet browser. Ensuring proper IE security require defining security zones, identifying security zone web site, customizing and administering the local computer security zone, and controlling security zone configuration settings. The chapter concludes with the malicious mobile code protection (MMC) that deals with protection against MMC annoyances like viruses, spyware, and rootkits.’}

The MBG was superior to the MCA and not inferior to the RBG with regard to precision and statistical weight per assay and per animal. The 111 valid MCA results were analysed with the full probit procedure, a simplified probit procedure, the logit transformation and the arc sine transformation. The potency estimates calculated with the full probit procedures were approached most closely by those obtained with the arc sine transformation; the simplified probit procedure and the logit transformation yielded results which agreed reasonably well with those of the full probit procedure in most cases, but there were some exceptions for which no explanation was found. The twin cross-over design contributed markedly to the precision of the RBG, but this was not the case for the MBG. A potency of 24·0 i.u. mg−1 was assigned to the European Pharmacopoeia Biological Reference Preparation for Insulin.}

abstract = {Publisher Summary
To understand and/or interpret the results of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logs from borehole measurements, it is imperative to conduct NMR laboratory measurements on brine and/or oil saturated rock samples first. Such measurements can be carried out to almost any desired accuracy using various means not readily available in a logging situation. For example, the measured NMR signals can be conveniently stacked many times to obtain a very high signal to noise ratio. One can study how the level of noise tends to affect the characteristics of the T2 distributions. When the water and oil signals are both present in the measurements, one can soak the core plugs in D2O to remove the water signal, or use the Magic Angle Spinning (MAS) technique to differentiate the two phases in high magnetic field. This chapter discusses the determination of irreducible water saturation, the understanding of oil T2 relaxation times regarding its viscosity and diffusion coefficient, as well as the establishment of permeability estimators, that are important in the laboratory for the understanding, interpretation, and applications of NMR logs to formation evaluation.}

This chapter focuses on the Kerberos authentication protocol, the default authentication protocol of Windows Server 2003. Microsoft introduced Kerberos as the new default authentication protocol for enterprise environments in Windows 2000. Every Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 operating system platform includes a client Kerberos authentication provider. Over the past years, Microsoft has been actively involved in the Kerberos standardization process. Microsoft software engineers participated in the creation of several Kerberos-related Internet drafts. The basic Kerberos protocol only deals with authentication. Microsoft's implementation of the protocol also includes extensions for authorization. The Kerberos protocol always deals with three entities: two entities that want to authenticate to one another and one entity that mediates between these two entities, a trusted third party or the key distribution center (KDC). To make Kerberos more scalable, the Kerberos developers included the concept of a KDC that is a trusted third party with which every entity shares a secret key. This key is called the entity's master key. All entities trust the KDC to mediate in their mutual authentication. The KDC also maintains a centralized authentication database containing a copy of every user's master key.}

Transmissivities are computed using three different formulations: a simple, standard method; one which accounts for unsaturated conditions and the use of one or two packers; and a method which assumes that the majority of the transmissivity is the result of a single, horizontal fracture. Results may be displayed graphically with depth along with the matrix values to detect significant secondary porosity. A methodology is presented for calibrating for head loss in the piping system to maximize the accuracy of computed results. The code takes flow-head loss data either interactively, or from a database holding previous calibration data. The data then are fit with a best-fit polynomial, the order of which is selected by the user. The best fit of the head loss data may be viewed graphically. A set of field collected pressure injection data is presented and analyzed using the code. The results demonstrate the influence that both the computational formulation and the head loss calibration may have on computed results.}

The approximate annual resolution of the time-series data permitted us to evaluate the influence of oceanic variables on the benthic environment and the accumulating varved sediment in the SBB. A bacterial mat community at or near the sediment surface is influencing sediment porosity and the production and distribution of Se. Early diagenesis dampens the amplitude of environmental signals in the geochemical time series. The concentrations of Sm and So increase with burial depth, at the expense of decreasing concentrations of Sx and Se. At depths greater than 5.5 cm, corresponding to an age of 7 years, Sm becomes the largest pool of reduced sulfur. It requires approximately 500 years of primarily bacterially mediated diagenesis, equivalent to a burial depth of ~ 1.4 m, for SBB sediments to gradually approach and finally enter the region assumed to represent typical “normal” marine sediments on a plot of weight percent TOC vs. Sm.}

Most of the features identified in a related study at Western Port were confirmed over the extended geographic range; however, an exception was that the production of fishes in the smallest size-classes (i.e. <1 g wet weight) was not consistently greater in seagrass habitat than unvegetated habitat. The more important characteristics of seagrass and unvegetated habitat types identified in the extended study were (1) more fish species were associated with seagrass habitat than unvegetated habitat, (2) the majority of small-fish species in both habitat types fed on crustaceans, with relatively few species capable of utilising algae and virtually no species utilising seagrass, (3) the few species that did ingest algae often occurred in high abundance, (4) the size of prey eaten by fishes increased consistently with fish size, with prey length averaging ≈6% of fish length, (5) abundant large fish species generally consumed smaller prey than rarer large fish species at the same body size, (6) greater benthic invertebrate and demersal fish production occurred in seagrass habitat than in unvegetated habitat, (7) most of the production of crustaceans >1-mm sieve size was ingested by fish predators while only a small proportion of non-crustacean benthic production was consumed. Fish production was highly correlated with crustacean production and seagrass biomass, and was negatively correlated with wave exposure (measured as fetch) across the range of sites. The estimated production of crustaceans was highly correlated with the biomass of seagrass material and also with the proportion of particles <63 μm in the sediments. The overall relationships between macrofaunal production (M; mg · m−2 · day−1), macrocrustacean production (C; mg · m−2 · day−1), demersal fish production (D; mg · m−2 · day−1), fetch (F; km), seagrass biomass (L; g · m−2), proportion of particles <63 μm (S;%) and temperature (T; °C) were: ln M = 1.41 + 0.088 ln (L + 1) + 0.38 ln S + 0.89 ln T, ln C = −0.93 + 0.27 ln (L + 1) + 0.22 ln S + 0.89 ln T, ln D = −1.23 − 0.62 ln F + 0.36 ln (L + 1) + 1.04 ln T.

abstract = {Multichannel reflection data (Tugolessov et al., 1985) have revealed two deeps in the basement topography of the Black Sea which are filled with sediments from 12 to 15 km thick. The deeps lack the “granitic layer” and are underlain by oceanic-type crust which we assume to be generated by seafloor spreading processes. The age of the deeps was interpreted previously, in a highly controversial manner, as being from the Paleozoic — Early Mesozoic to the Recent. In the paper, age estimations were undertaken using surficial heat flow data, assuming that they are related to deep-seated age-dependent heat flow generated by the cooling oceanic lithosphere, but that they are strongly distorted by the heating of continuously accumulating sediments as well as by additional heat input from radiogenic production within sediments. Using reliable thermophysical parameters of compacting sediments, the distorted heat flow in the sediments was evaluated numerically. This allowed us to estimate the age of the Black Sea deeps floor. The results show that the West Black Sea deep is 130 to 95 m.y. old, and the East Black Sea deep is nearly 110 m.y. old. These figures support an interpretation of the Black Sea deeps as remnants of a Late Mesozoic back-arc basin that evolved behind the Lesser Caucasian — Pontide island arc. The inferred Middle Cretaceous age of the deeps is the first estimate obtained quantitatively, and corresponds well with available heat flow and multichannel reflection data.}
