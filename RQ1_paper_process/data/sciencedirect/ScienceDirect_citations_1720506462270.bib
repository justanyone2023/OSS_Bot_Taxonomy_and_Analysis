abstract = {Within the frame of an air quality study of the Great Casablanca Area (GCA), an atmospheric emission inventory concerning the major pollutants: SO2; NOx; non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC); and CO has been realized. This inventory has a spatial resolution of 1 km2 and is established for the reference year 1992. The area, which covers 2500 km2 includes a region which is very sensitive to atmospheric pollution since it is heavily populated and contains up to 60% of the industrial activities of Morocco. The results, which include both biogenic and anthropogenic sources, show as expected very large emissions of pollutants mainly due to the presence of a refinery, several power plants and, contrary to the general European situation, the production of NOx is not dominated by road traffic.}

This chapter describes the adverse effects of neuromuscular blocking agents and skeletal muscle relaxants. Persistent paralysis has been reported after the long-term administration of neuromuscular blocking agents in critically ill patients. Neuromuscular transmission monitoring helps avoid the overdosing of neuromuscular blocking agents, which might prevent persistent paralysis. Glucocorticoids have been linked to acute quadriplegic myopathy and severe muscle weakness in patients receiving neuromuscular blocking agents. Heterotopic ossification or myositis ossificans has been reported after the long-term administration of neuromuscular blocking agents to patients in intensive care units. Allergic reactions to muscle relaxants result in a massive release of cell mediators, such as histamine, tryptase, serotonin, kinins, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes. This release is usually triggered by the bridging of IgE-receptor complexes with allergens. Tertiary and quaternary ammonium ions are important elements at the allergenic site of muscle relaxants that may explain cross-reactivity among muscle relaxants. Plasma tryptase concentration is a sensitive and relatively specific marker of anaphylaxis.}

Based on the temperature gradient and thickening mechanisms, the thickening phenomenon was investigated for the SCLP forming and application widely. The bending zone thickness increases after laser bending of the SCLP. Then, an IPP image processing software was used to evaluate the grain size and thickness changes in laser bending zone. There are three areas they are stainless steel squeezed layer on the top, carbon steel extended layer at the middle and the bottom layer of stainless steel. The research results show that the grain size increases bigger in laser bending process which means thermal expansion thickening (TET) on one hand. In the positive bending process, grains extended by laser heating are squeezed through the bending stress and extrusion thickening (ET) on the other hand. The sizes of both stainless steel at upper layer and carbon steel layer at middle get thicker, but the bottom stainless layer changed little. The research outcomes also show the thickening size consists of TET and ET, where TET effect accounts for great proportion in the range of bending angle 5-20 degree. While ET effect increases in the range of bending angle 30-60 degree, the thickening ratio of TET and ET reaches 2 to 3 at bigger angles. The researches of the thickening phenomenon provide a deeper understand on laser bending theory and technology.}

Recently, AHSG was found to be the species equivalent protein of fetuin, the major fetal serum protein in cattle and sheep. The function and regulation of AHSG/fetuin in different species are not understood. We have isolated a liver cDNA clone that encodes the human AHSG/bovine fetuin homologue in the mouse. The AHSG/fetuin gene may have a role in differentiation since it is expressed in mouse limb buds and brain only at certain stages during development. Mouse liver AHSG/fetuin mRNA was present at low level at 12 days gestation but its level increased during the late part of gestation and peaked between 1 to 3 months after birth. The regulation of mouse AHSG/fetuin synthesis during development was found to be significantly different from that of sheep and bovine fetuin. Compared to fetuin, which is reduced in adult to 1 to 2% of the fetal level, mouse AHSG synthesis subsides only 50% 4 months after birth.}

abstract = {Historically, the high latitude ionosphere has been viewed as the most complex of the ionospheric regions because it is driven by both magnetospheric and solar inputs. At lower latitudes the direct, and highly variable, magnetospheric input is relatively unimportant, which makes these other regions amenable to empirical modeling. To date, however, no empirical model of the high latitude ionosphere is available which includes these complex dependencies. On the other hand, numerical models that include the physics of this region have been developed and have proven to be successful at the climatology level. In this study we present the climatological results of one of these models, namely the Utah State University (USU) timedependent ionospheric model (TDIM). A total of 108 separate TDIM simulations for different ionospheric conditions were used to elucidate the high latitude ionospheric trends. These trends depend on solar cycle, season, universal time (UT), magnetic activity, interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) orientation, and hemisphere. The ionospheric climatology is not dominated by any one of these parameters. The solar cycle (F10.7 index), season (day), and magnetic activity (Kp index) compete on an even footing for control of the high latitude ionosphere. Mean variations of over an order of magnitude in NmF2, of over 150 km in hmF2, and of over 50 km in the transition height are present in the high latitude ionospheric climatology. The 108 simulations quantify the trends and show the UT dependence and spatial variability of the ionosphere. Some aspects of these UT trends are compared successfully with observations. Many of the simulation results are predictions that can be verified as more complete observational databases become available. The UT dependence, which at times can be a factor of two modulation of the F region densities, is a key reason for the failure of statistical models at high latitudes. At lower latitudes, statistical models based mainly on local time rather than UT have been very successful. At high latitudes, this is not so and, therefore, local time and UT (longitude) must be treated as independent variables. This fact alone explains why data sets based on a fixed ground location or satellite orbital plane cannot unravel the LT and UT dependencies at high latitudes. Also, the high latitude ionosphere is not spatially uniform; morphological features on latitudinal scales of 1–2 ° are present. These structures play a key role in identifying the ionospheric climatology.}

Last year at the Guelph meeting I had my first good taste of illumination and liked it to the last drop. At that time I remember there was some discussion regarding what illumination would do for the late hatched pullets. At that time I had hatched five different ages of leghorn pullets for the purpose of a demonstration as to the proper or most desirable time of hatching for egg production. It was therefore an easy matter to divide these pullets into two lots and provide electric lights for one and allow the other to get along as best it could without. The pullets were therefore divided into two pens A. and B. and in each pen there were eight pullets from each of five different hatches but all hatched from eggs produced by the same pen. The hatching dates were for lot 1, March first, lot 2, March 25, . . .}

The second form of training, which used to attract less attention, aims at increasing cyber security awareness among non-security professionals and the general public. Conducting such training programs requires dedicated testbeds and infrastructures that help realizing and executing the training scenarios and provide a playground for the trainees. A cyber range is an environment that aims at providing such testbeds. The purpose of this paper is to study the concept of a cyber range, and provide a systematic literature review that covers unclassified cyber ranges and security testbeds. In this study we develop a taxonomy for cyber range systems and evaluate the current literature focusing on architecture and scenarios, but including also capabilities, roles, tools and evaluation criteria.

Review of software artifacts, such as source or test code, is a common practice in industrial practice. However, although review guidelines are available for source and low-level test code, for GUI-based testing artifacts, such guidelines are missing.
Objective:
The goal of this work is to define a set of guidelines from literature about production and test code, that can be mapped to GUI-based testing artifacts.
Method:
A systematic literature review is conducted, using white and gray literature to identify guidelines for source and test code. These synthesized guidelines are then mapped, through examples, to create actionable, and applicable, guidelines for GUI-based testing artifacts.
Results:
The results of the study are 33 guidelines, summarized in nine guideline categories, that are successfully mapped as applicable to GUI-based testing artifacts. Of the collected literature, only 10 sources contained test-specific code review guidelines. These guideline categories are: perform automated checks, use checklists, provide context information, utilize metrics, ensure readability, visualize changes, reduce complexity, check conformity with the requirements and follow design principles and patterns.
Conclusion:
This pivotal set of guidelines provides an industrial contribution in filling the gap of general guidelines for review of GUI-based testing artifacts. Additionally, this work highlights, from an academic perspective, the need for future research in this area to also develop guidelines for other specific aspects of GUI-based testing practice, and to take into account other facets of the review process not covered by this work, such as reviewer selection.}

Serotonergic dysregulation in obsessive-compulsive disorder has been repeatedly demonstrated. Recent reports on the emergence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in patients treated with clozapine support a hyposerotonergic hypothesis of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The authors report the emergence of de novo compulsive symptoms in a drug-naive 8-year-old schizophrenic child, shortly after the initiation of treatment with clothiapine. Clothiapine, an atypical antipsychotic agent, shares with clozapine its strong antiserotonergic properties. It seems that antagonistic activity of atypical neuroleptics at postsynaptic serotonergic receptors might be responsible for the development of iatrogenic obsessive-compulsive symptoms.}

This chapter provides a brief retrospective on how policy-based network management (PBNM) was designed. It outlines two fundamental problems—the lack of use of an information model and the inability to use business rules to drive configuration of devices, services, and networks. Quality of service (QoS) is one of the primary drivers for implementing PBNM solutions. PBNM solutions require information models that contain business and system entities that can be easily implemented. The chapter introduces a unique object-oriented information model, known as DEN-ng (Directory Enabled Networks-new generation). It is being developed in the TM Forum. An object-oriented information model is a means to represent various entities in a managed environment. An entity can be a person, a computer, a router, or even a protocol message—anything that needs a uniform and consistent representation for configuration and management is a possibility for definition and representation in DEN-ng. An object-oriented information model provides a common language in which different types of management entities can be represented.}

The specimens occur in the Early Cretaceous Baqueró Formation, near Estancia El Verano in the Santa Cruz Province, Argentina. A detailed stratigraphic section records four facies, namely (1) fluvial channel, (2) flood plain, (3) lacustrine, and (4) flat and extended plains. A detail of each facies is provided. Pseudoctenis cuticles are found in the flood plain facies; the other components of the plant association are Gleichenites, Araucaria and Taeniopteris. The depositional history of this succession is related to a braided river that periodically received volcanic ash. Plants grew until complete burial by ash. Leaves of Pseudoctenis are pinnate, hypostomatic, with polycyclic stomata that form ill-defined rows. Abundant papillae and hair bases are present, especially on the lower cuticle. Comparisons are made with other Pseudoctenis species found in the same formation, and in other regions of the world. It is suggested that the paleoenvironment had a strong influence on the vegetation, especially the ash fall, and that it may have played a role in the formation of xeromorphic structures that characterize several gymnosperms present in this stratigraphic unit, including Pseudoctenis ornata. The lack of burning features on the cuticle suggests a cold ash fall. This fall probably was responsible for changes in edaphic patterns and atmospheric conditions that governed the growth and distribution of plant communities during the deposition of the Baqueró Formation.}

abstract = {Chemiluminescence (CL) was used to study the uptake of differently sized model drug carriers (polystyrene latex particles) by human granulocytes. The polystyrene particles were incubated with the granulocytes on microtitre plates and the CL monitored for a period of 3 hours. The sensitivity of the chemiluminescence (CL) assay could be increased by optimization of the luminol concentration, cell number and particle number (mass) per well. The intensity (uptake)/time profiles were characterized by the intensity Imax (uptake velocity) and the area under the curve (AUC, total uptake of particles). The reproducibility within one cell isolation was good. To compare CL measurements from different isolations internal standards were included to compensate for biological variations in the granulocyte function. The total uptake of particles increased with increasing particle size and at low to medium particle concentrations. It levelled or even decreased at high particle concentrations reducing the sensitivity of the assay. The AUC correlated with the total mass of phagocytosed particles and could therefore be used to compare the uptake of nano- and microparticles differing in size.}

Fourteen colonies from 4 ant species [Aphaenogaster rudis Emery, Lasius alienus Foerster, Formica subsericea Say, and Camponotus ferrigineus (F.)] were behaviorally tested for olfactory and gustatory responses to seeds of A. candense. Results indicate that ants do not perceive these seeds, which have elaiosomes, by olfaction. Rather, they respond to these seeds only if the seeds are antennated. These results indicate that these ants are not “attracted” to A. canadense seeds by olfactory cues. Electroantennograms (EAGs) recorded from F. subsericea in response to olfactory and gustatory application of mixed isomer diolein, a major component of many seed elaiosomes, support the behavioral data. Olfactory delivery produced EAG responses no different from that of controls, while gustatory delivery produced responses with dose-dependence. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the antennae of A. rudis, F. subsericea, and C. ferrigineus revealed the presence of sensilla chaetica, presumed to be contact chemoreceptors, and sensilla placodea and/or sensilla trichodea curvata that are believed to be olfactory receptors.}

However, the intricate nature of IoT connections and device vulnerabilities exposes the devices to security threats. To address the security challenges, we propose a proactive defense framework that leverages a model-based approach for security analysis and facilitates the defense strategies. Our proposed approach incorporates proactive defense mechanisms that combine Moving Target Defense techniques with cyber deception. The proposed approach involves the use of a decoy nodes as a deception technique and operating system based diversity as a moving target defense strategy to change the attack surface area of IoT networks. Additionally, we introduce a technique known as Important Measure-based Operating System Diversity to reduce defense cost. The effectiveness of the defense mechanisms was evaluated by using a graphical security model in a Software Defined Networking-based IoT network. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating the impact of attacks while maintaining high performance levels in IoT networks.}

During ripening, sucrose content decreased while fructose and glucose contents increased. Citric and malic acid contents slightly increased during the early stage of ripening and decreased thereafter. Amino acids did not change significantly, except for proline, which increased rapidly towards the late stage of ripening. While 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) content and ACC synthase activity increased in parallel with ethylene production, ACC oxidase activity was already high when harvested at the turning stage and further increased during ripening. Application of 1000 ppm ethylene for 24 h did not induce earlier onset of ethylene production when applied on harvest day, but was effective when applied one day or five days after harvest. The results indicate that purple passion fruit produces ethylene with the same biosynthetic pathway as other tissues in higher plants; its ethylene biosynthesis is regulated mainly by ACC synthase activity, and the sensitivity to ethylene might have changed after harvest as the fruit ripened.}

Male Wistar rats were trained to respond for ethanol (10% w/v) or water in a two-lever free-choice opérant condition. Acute administration of acamprosate (400 mg/kg) reduced ethanol consumption and increased responding for water. Chronic administration of lower daily doses of acamprosate (100 and 200 mg/kg) blocked the increased ethanol consumption typically observed in rats after an imposed abstinence period. This effect of acamprosate was selective for ethanol, as responding for water was unaffected at any dose tested. These results with rats suggest a model by which to explore the mechanisms for anti-relapse effects of acamprosate.}

Four kinetic components were resolved. Decay-associated spectra and comparative analysis showed that the fluorescence of leaves, on both sides, was dominated by the fast (0.3 ns) and the medium (1 ns) kinetic components, comprising fluorophores emitting principally in the blue and present in the epidermal layer. In the mesophyll, these two faster components have two maxima, in the blue and in the green part of the spectrum, with a shift of the blue maxima to longer wavelengths when compared to leaves. The slow component (3.5 ns) was green-related with a strong indication for the presence of flavins. The very slow component (9 ns) had a maximal fractional intensity in mesophyll and was blue-related. The excitation and emission characteristics and the effect of anaerobic atmosphere on the fractional intensities of the slow and very slow component showed that they contain fluorescence of flavin nucleotides and nicotinamide nucleotides, respectively. Time-resolved measurements could be a means to extract the information on nucleotide fluorescence from the overall leaf fluorescence, and therefore to evaluate changes in mesophyll redox sate.}

Irradiation was for 6 h daily for 21 days starting at 9 days after planting. After irradiation, plants were inoculated with one or two blast isolates. In 18 out of 36 measured interactions the number of lesions per plant was higher in the presence of UV-B than in its absence. However, only two interactions were statistically significant. In a second experiment the dose-response relationship between the cultivars IR30 and IR72 and UV-B was established in the presence and absence of disease. Increasing levels of UV-B significantly reduced leaf areas, dry weights, and heights of both cultivars. Disease severity was either unaffected or decreased by UV-B. However, disease significantly changed the effects of UV-B on plant growth and recovery from UV-B damage. IR30 but not IR72 recovered from UV-B damage in the absence of disease within 5 days. No recovery occurred when inoculated. IR72 suffered even greater reductions of leaf area and dry weight by UV-B when inoculated. Although the effects of UV-B on disease severity may be small, it appears that the tolerance of plants to disease is decreased by UV-B radiation.}

abstract = {Outsourcing is not a recent phenomenon in the industry. Companies have been outsourcing non-core services or functions for many years. Outsourcing of IT management picked up in the late 80's and since then it has mushroomed into a multi-billion dollar industry. Initially the key driver for outsourcing was controlling operational expenses but over the period of time several other factors have been prominent such as flexibility in control of investments and resources, risk sharing, acquisition of special skills and competencies, revenue sharing, establishing long term strategic relationship, etc. The decision of outsourcing attaches special significance in the strategy formulation in the company or any operation. Large numbers of research papers have been published in the past two decades on outsourcing and researchers have studied and analyzed various internal and external factors having bearing on outsourcing decision. Over a period of time new business models and frameworks have emerged helping decision makers in the process. Some researchers have adopted research methodologies that are case studies based or while others have designed empirical formulations by conducting extensive surveys. Interestingly most conclusions from these studies tend to converge on similar set of key factors. This paper provides detailed review of the published research body of knowledge on outsourcing IT management and explores relevance to telecom operations. In the case of telecom operators, it is observed that the basic set of parameters influencing the decision of outsourcing is same as rest of the industry. In the recent past, it is observed that telecom operators have extended this model by outsourcing management of network infrastructure, management of towers, billing systems, marketing, etc. This is creating new working models and relationships. The paper concludes by providing the direction for the future research work in this domain}

To examine and classify the vacua of the quantum gauge theory, we propose an effective action in which the gauge field coupling constant g is replaced by the effective coupling g(t), t = ln[Fμνa)2μ4]. The vacua of this model correspond to paramagnetism and perfect paramagnetism, for which the gauge field is Fμνa = 0, and ferromagnetism, for which (Fμνa)2 = λ2, i.e. spontaneous magnetization of the vacuum occurs. We show that there are no instanton solutions to the quantum effective action. The equations for a point classical source of color spin are solved, and we show that the field infrared energy becomes linearly divergent in the limit of spontaneous magnetization. This implies bag formation, and an electric Meissner effect confining the bag contents.}

Airborne contamination of the wound area and the CPB circuit was performed by aerosolizing Staphylococcus aureus. A membrane oxygenator in the CPB circuit maintained a normal host defense mechanism. The use of cardiotomy suction during CPB with this type of oxygenator affected the host defense to some extent. The use of a bubble oxygenator in the CPB circuit together with cardiotomy suction seriously impaired the host defense. Postoperatively bacteremia developed in no dogs in the membrane oxygenator group, whereas 8 of 15 dogs in the bubble oxygenator group had a positive blood culture for the indicator microorganism.

A laboratory study was also conducted to determine the amount of organic carbon added to soil during decomposition. The dry weight loss of litter under field and laboratory conditions, respectively, were 94 and 74% for albizia, 64% and 60% for eucalypt and 96 and 92% for teak. The decay rate of the three types of litters varied significantly both in the field and in the laboratory. Teak litter decomposed rapidly as compared with others; decomposition of eucalypt litter was the slowest. Weight loss was positively correlated with litter moisture content as well as rainfall. The CO2 evolution differed significantly between the species, but in general it was highest during the southwest monsoon. The weight loss and CO2 evolution were significantly higher in the field than in the laboratory. No significant addition of organic carbon to soil from decomposing litters was evident in the present study. Eucalypt differed statistically from albizia and teak with respect to the bacterial pearl gram of litter, irrespective of the period of sampling or incubation condition. However, bacterial population did not vary significantly between albizia and teak litters. The number of fungi per gram of litter differed significantly between eucalypt and albizia, and that of actinomycetes between teak and eucalypt litters, both in the field and laboratory conditions. Between other pairs, the population and actinomycetes did not vary significantly. The CO2 evolution was positively correlated with number of fungi per gram of litter in albizia and teak in the field; it was not correlated with the population of bacteria and actinomycetes.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Substantial physician workload and high costs are associated with the treatment of dyspepsia in primary health care. Despite the availability of consensus statements and guidelines, the most cost-effective empirical strategy for initial management of the condition remains to be determined. We compared step-up and step-down treatment strategies for initial management of patients with new onset dyspepsia in primary care.
Methods
Patients aged 18 years and older who consulted with their family doctor for new onset dyspepsia in the Netherlands were eligible for enrolment in this double-blind, randomised controlled trial. Between October, 2003, and January, 2006, 664 patients were randomly assigned to receive stepwise treatment with antacid, H2-receptor antagonist, and proton pump inhibitor (step-up; n=341), or these drugs in the reverse order (step-down; n=323), by use of a computer-generated sequence with blocks of six. Each step lasted 4 weeks and treatment only continued with the next step if symptoms persisted or relapsed within 4 weeks. Primary outcomes were symptom relief and cost-effectiveness of initial management at 6 months. Analysis was by intention to treat (ITT); the ITT population consisted of all patients with data for the primary outcome at 6 months. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00247715.
Findings
332 patients in the step-up, and 313 in the step-down group reached an endpoint with sufficient data for evaluation; the main reason for dropout was loss to follow-up. Treatment success after 6 months was achieved in 238 (72%) patients in the step-up group and 219 (70%) patients in the step-down group (odds ratio 0·92, 95% CI 0·7–1·3). The average medical costs were lower for patients in the step-up group than for those in the step-down group (€228 vs €245; p=0·0008), which was mainly because of costs of medication. One or more adverse drug events were reported by 94 (28%) patients in the step-up and 93 (29%) patients in the step-down group. All were minor events, including (other) dyspeptic symptoms, diarrhoea, constipation, and bad/dry taste.
Interpretation
Although treatment success with either step-up or step-down treatment is similar, the step-up strategy is more cost effective at 6 months for initial treatment of patients with new onset dyspeptic symptoms in primary care.

This paper introduces a new hypervisor-based cloud intrusion detection system (IDS) that uses online multivariate statistical change analysis to detect anomalous network behaviors. As a departure from the conventional monolithic network IDS feature model, we leverage the fact that a hypervisor consists of a collection of instances, to introduce an instance-oriented feature model that exploits the individual and correlated behaviors of instances to improve the detection capability. The proposed approach is evaluated by collecting and using a new cloud intrusion dataset that includes a wide variety of attack vectors.}

Using two ships at sea in various vessel encounter situations (relative bearing angles of 000°, 045°, 090°, and 135°), the perceived ship collision risk (PSCR) was estimated by the ship operators. Then, the mean values of all the measured parameters were used to identify the bearing angle corresponding to the highest PSCR. The MCRBA was compared to the maximum frequency collision bearing angle (MFCBA) derived by investigating 200 reported ship collision cases in Korean waters. The highest experimental PSCR values were observed at a relative bearing angle of 135°, which corresponded to the results of collision case analyses stating that the MFCBA was equal to 112.5°–135°. Notably, the PSCR magnitude increased most significantly at a distance of 1.25–1 NM in experiments involving various vessel encounter situations. Collision risk factors such as the MCRBA and DCRBIS can thus be used in the development of collision prevention protocols for ship operators.}

The ultrastructure of a colourless amoeboid flagellate, Cercomonas sp. isolated from fresh water, is considered. This minute organism possesses two heterodynamic flagella. When moving it actively crawls along the substratum, persistently forming pseudopodia of various shape and size. The vesicular nucleus with a central nucleolus is located anteriorly, close the two kinetosomes. The system of kinetosome-derived microtubules forms a conical sheath around the nucleus. The Golgi apparatus, the endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria with tubular cristae have usual structure. A paranuclear body surrounded by a unit membrane is observed in the cells. The cytoplasm is filled with food vacuoles and drops of storage substances. Beneath the body surface, there are stinging organelles affecting bacteria. Peculiarities of the ultrastructure relate Cercomonas with the chrysophyte algae and myxomycetes.}

Three major forest types were examined: Rhizophora-Bruguiera, Nypa and Avicennia-Sonneratia forests. For most variables, variations within a forest type were as great as, or greater than, differences between forest types. A high-intertidal Nypa site was most different in edaphic characteristics compared to five low-intertidal stations (two stations in each forest type) suggesting that differences among forest types in earlier studies were mainly a function of tidal elevation rather than species-specific ability of mangroves to influence redox and nutrient status. Dissolved inorganic nutrients were dominated by high (~ 200–500 μM) concentrations of silicates, but porewater phosphate levels were usually below detection limits (<0.02μM). Measured rates of nutrient regeneration were either slow into the sediment, or undetectable, despite a high concentration gradient for some solutes such as silicate. Rates of bacterial DNA and protein synthesis, and patterns of benthic primary production, indicate uptake of nutrients at the sediment-water interface by epibenthic microalgac and sequestering of porewater solutes by very active, subsurface bacterial communities. Rapid growth of these bacteria may be partially maintained by the decomposition and release of nutrients of mangrove roots and rhizomes, as suggested by the dominance of silicate in the porewater. Correlation analysis supports the notion of nutrient (mainly P) limitation of bacteria and microalgac in mangrove muds. It appears that a close microbe-nutricnt-planl connection serves as a mechanism to conserve scarce nutrients necessary for the existence of these tropical tidal forests.}

abstract = {With the continuous emergence of various network attacks, it is becoming more and more important to ensure the security of the network. Intrusion detection, as one of the important technologies to ensure network security, has been widely studied. However, class imbalance leads to a challenging problem, that is, the normal data is much more than the attack data. Class imbalance will lead to the deviation of decision boundary, which makes higher value attack data classification error. In the face of imbalanced data, how to make the classification model classify more effectively is called imbalanced learning problem. In this study, we propose a tabular data sampling method to solve the imbalanced learning problem, which aims to balance the normal samples and attack samples. Firstly, for normal samples, on the premise of minimizing the loss of sample information, the K-nearest neighbor method is used for effective undersampling. Then, we design a tabular auxiliary classifier generative adversarial networks model (TACGAN) for attack sample oversampling. TACGAN model is an extension of ACGAN model. We add two loss functions in the generator to measure the information loss between real data and generated data, which makes TACGAN more suitable for the generation of tabular data. Finally, the normal data after undersampling and the attack data after oversampling are mixed to balance the data. We have carried out verification experiments on three real intrusion detection data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves excellent results in Accuracy, F1, AUC and Recall.}

Under the conditions of a standard genetic cross, recombinants first appear about 6 hr after infection, the time of formation of the first infectious progeny virus, and their frequency progressively rises until about 20 hr postinfection. During this period the frequency of mixed plaques remained constant at approximately 5%. The frequency of mixed plaques and recombinants were both increased several-fold when crosses were made in the presence of the DNA synthesis inhibitor 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR). In view of the genetic instability of the partially heterozygous genomes of mixed plaque forming virus this result is interpreted to mean that mixed plaques identify virus which is an intermediate in recombinant formation and that the molecular structure of their genome is probably that of a partial heteroduplex. Measurements of deoxynucleoside triphosphate pools showed that FUdR inhibited the large increase in the dTTP pool size which normally accompanies HSV-1 infection of BHK cells.}

While classically identified with IgE dependent allergy and innate immunity, mast cells are also known to play an indispensible role in modulating other effector cells, and delineating subsequent adverse pulmonary outcomes. The activation and function of mast cells is integral to the etiology of numerous lung pathophysiologies, exacerbation of pre-existing pulmonary conditions and detrimental toxicant exposures. Several therapeutics targeting mast cell activation and downstream effects of mediators have been developed to neutralize allergy and hypersensitivity. Advancements in mast cell biology have renewed focus on the importance of mast cells in pulmonary physiology and disease pathology.}

Northern blot analysis revealed that the gene, termed alcan, was expressed in various types of human cancer cell lines and in the fetus, but not in normal tissues. The alcan gene is located on chromosome 6 and is encoded on a 246-amino-acid protein with weak homology to classical major histocompatibility complex class I. Its gene product, ALCAN, had hydrophobic amino acid clusters at both the N- and C-terminal regions and was predicted to be a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane protein. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that ALCAN was detected on the surface of human cancer cells and on alcan-transfected CHO-K1 cells. ALCAN was also secreted from these cells, suggesting that some portion of the molecules was secreted by enzymatic cleavage by, for example, phospholipases. Mutational analysis of ALCAN suggested that the GPI-anchored position was the Ser216 residue. These findings indicate that ALCAN may be a potential target for cancer diagnosis or therapy.}

Compared with dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) liposomes, the phase-transition temperatures (Tc) of the present two glycolipid liposomes were about 11–15°C higher and the fluidity at the surface of these glycolipid liposome was considerably lower. This means that the interaction between neighboring diglucoside headgroups may be stronger than that between phosphatidylcholine headgroups. Fluorospectrometric and CPK model studies suggested that the structural difference in anomerization and epimerization of the disaccharide moiety of glyceroglycolipids is an important factor for determining the physicochemical properties of these glycolipid liposomes.}

abstract = {Production cost in the desalination plants remains to be a major constraint on the development and promotion of the water processing industry. Water is heavily subsidized in those countries where the only source of water for domestic supply is desalinated water. Searching for cost reduction measures, essentially involves analysis of the financing system under which a desalination plant is constructed, operated and maintained. In Bahrain, where natural water resources are extremely limited and fresh groundwater of requisite quality is becoming scarce, desalination of water is ranked as a must. The desalinated water is blended with groundwater to provide a domestic supply within the necessary quality limits. However, to keep pace with increasing demand and minimize the need to draw water from the aquifer, new desalination plants are required. In this paper the authors discuss the role of privatization as a financing alternative in the desalination industry in Bahrain, and its influence on the production cost. Available data from the existing operated plants in Bahrain throughout the past fifteen years are analyzed with a view to assert this possibility.}

abstract = {Dorinnotheca streelii Fairon-Demaret, gen. et sp. nov. is described from three upper Famennian localities in Belgium. This new early seed plant bears cupules hanging singly at the tips of the slender ultimate axes of a pinnately branched system. Each cupule encloses a single, centrally located preovule with four free integumentary lobes. At the base of the fertile unit, the cupule segments are fused for a quarter of their total length; higher up they are free, recurved and highly dissected. The integumentary lobes appear joined to the fused part of the cupule segments. The preovule is sessile; at the apex, the nucellus shows a long, tubular, salpinx-like extension. This distinctive type of organisation is discussed in relation to the other Late Devonian preovulate structures from which it appears different.}

Three heat sum models using different statistical methods for deriving base temperatures were tested. The base temperatures varied widely depending both on the development stage of the crop and on the statistical method of derivation. The base temperature models were found to be no more accurate for predicting development than a simple heat sum model. In general the most accurate method for predicting development was found to be a multiple regression model. This model incorporated temperature soil moisture and daylength effects during the vegetative growth stage, and temperature and soil moisture effects during the reproductive and maturation stages of growth. A test of this model against an independent set of seven crops from two widely contrasting environments confirmed the generality of this type of model for sunflower.}

To ensure the Internet security, effective detection and mitigation for such attacks are indispensable. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative intrusion prevention architecture, i.e. CIPA, aiming at confronting such coordinated intrusion behavior. CIPA is deployed as a virtual network of an artificial neural net over the substrate of networks. Taking advantage of the parallel and simple mathematical manipulation of neurons in a neural net, CIPA can disperse its lightweight computation power to the programmable switches of the substrate. Each programmable switch virtualizes one to several neurons. The whole neural net functions like an integrated IDS/IPS. This allows CIPA to detect distributed attacks on a global view. Meanwhile, it does not require high communication and computation overhead. It is scalable and robust. To validate CIPA, we have realized a prototype on Software-Defined Networks. We also conducted simulations and experiments. The results demonstrate that CIPA is effective.}

A total of 321 Beijing Black pig sows were genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method, with the Alu I and Sma I for PRLR and BF genes, respectively. Two different alleles of PRLR and BF genes were identified: allele A (0.25) and B (0.75) of the PRLR gene, allele A (0.13) and B (0.86) of the BF gene. The association analysis between the genotypes and the litter size were estimated with the method of the general linear model. The analysis results of PRLR showed that in first parity, sows with genotype AA had a larger litter size than sows with genotype AB and BB, but the difference was statistically not significant. In later parities, statistically significant (P < 0.05) differences were seen between sows with genotypes AA and AB, and BB of the PRLR gene. The associated analysis results between genotypes and litter size (total number born, TNB, and number born alive, NBA) showed that there were no significant differences in the first parity sows with different genotypes of the BF gene, but significant differences appeared in NBA between the sows of genotypes AB and BB, in later parity, for which significantly higher values were observed in the offspring of heterozygotes. Considering the consistent genotypic effect on the litter size of both sows in first parity and later parity, it was concluded that the locus of the PRLR gene, digested with Alu I, could be the gene maker for the litter size in Beijing Black pigs.}

The basalt layer which makes the bottom of the basin has been dated as 8 Ma. The lacustrine sedimentation occurred contemporaneously with active volcanic phases in the region. Silicic aggregates are common in the cements and as important mineralogic constitutents of these phases whereas periods of calm sedimentation are characterized by thick lignite seams and the presence of authigenic minerals such as pyrite and vivianite. The sequence shows a general upward fining and evolution from shallow fluviatile to reduced lacustrine basin. The palynoflora from the sequence has a unique palaeofloral assemblage where the abundance of Guineo-Congolian-like pollen taxa, pteridophytes and absence of conifers imply a regional palaeoaltitude much lower than at present. The uplift of the Plateau at a rate of 0.1 mm yr−1 similarly suggests palaeotitudes of ca 900–1000 m.}

The present paper reports on the characterisation of the photosynthetic responses to a single pulse of ozone (150 ppb for 5 hours) in the leaves of two tobacco cultivars displaying different degrees of sensitivity to O3 (BelB, O3-resistant and BelW3, O3-sensitive). In the BelW3 cultivars, O3 induced a decrease in the photosynthetic rate, but not in actual PSII efficiency at steady-state photosynthesis. The reduction state of QA did not change in these plants while a strong decrease in intrinsic PSII efficiency was observed. The quantum yield for photosynthetic CO2 assimilation decreased more than the actual PSII efficiency, suggesting the presence of a significant fraction of electron transport to molecular oxygen or the existence of some form of cyclic electron flow. O3-treated leaves reduced the excess of absorbed light (i.e. light that couldn't be used in photosynthesis) by dissipating a large part of the light absorbed by the PSII antenna as heath. In BelB, the CO2 assimilation rate did not change in the presence of the pollutant O3 and the only gas exchange parameter that changed was the stomatal conductance, which significantly increased. Some of the Chl fluorescence parameters changed after O3 fumigation, but returned to values similar to the controls when measured 24 hours after removing the stress. The only Chl fluorescence parameter that significantly increased during the recovery phase was the 1-qP}

The isotherm is found to have two plateaus as a function of solution concentration. The activity of fibrinogen adsorbed at different surface concentrations in promoting platelet adhesion is investigated by preadsorbing fibrinogen on the surface of the biomaterial and subsequently exposing it to fresh porcine blood, without any exposure to air. It is found that platelet adhesion increases with increasing concentration of preadsorbed fibrinogen until the surface concentration exceeds that in the first plateau. Higher surface concentrations of preadsorbed fibrinogen do not promote further platelet adhesion. This would indicate that the fibrinogen preadsorbed in the first plateau is conformationally changed sufficiently to promote platelet adhesion, but that in the second plateau is apparently not changed to the same extent.}

Milled sawdust of the trunkwood of Tilia cordataMill., exhibits lipolytic activity when incubated with emulsified olive oil. The lipase of the peripheral trunk zone shows optimal activity at a pH of 7.5 and between 37–45 °C. The lipase is neither inhibited nor activited by sodiumdesoxycholate. Lipase activity decreases towards the centre of the trunk. Washing the peripheral wood particles with water prior to incubation results in an increased lipolytic activity. The inhibtor extracted appears to be largely water insoluble in the older wood zones. In the water extracts, only traces of lipase activity are measurable. Most of the lipase seems to be tightly associated with the woody cell walls. The acidic value of the lipids extracted from the different radial wood zones suggests that only the peripheral trunkwood tissue exhibits high lipase activity.}

The particle-size distribution were measured by instruments appropriate to each powder system. Five powders, with four different absolute densities (2.8 – 19.3 g/cm3) and with FSSS numbers from 0.9 to 8.0 were sudied. Jostling of powders in containers during transportation was simulated by controlled tapping of the powders in a demountable cylinder. Segregation did take place when a wide distribution was present, unless masked by the break-up of afflomerates and consequent generation of fines during tapping.}

The device utilizes lines of light, obtained from laser diodes, that are focussed on the sample and permit measurements with a spatial resolution of 40 μm. In cross sections of spinach leaves (700 μm thick) the profile for the photothermal signals is bell shaped and coincides closely with the chlorophyll content of the tissues. By contrast, the profile for oxygen evolution is relatively flat, suggesting uniform capacity for oxygen evolution in the mesophyll. Maximum values for relative quantum yield for oxygen evolution are found in palisade tissues near the adaxial leaf surface. The photoacoustic device shows that it is possible to collect thermal and oxygen signals from microscopic leaf samples and opens a new avenue for studies of leaf structure—function.}

Increased use and reliance on technologies complicate the process of providing information security. This expanding complexity in supplying data security requirements coupled with the increased recognition of the value of information, have led to the need to quickly advance the information security area. In this paper, we examine the maturation of the information security area by analyzing the innovation activity of one of the largest and most ubiquitous information technology companies, Microsoft. We conduct a textual analysis of their patent application activity in the information security domain since the early 2000's using a novel text analysis approach based on concepts from social network analysis and algorithmic classification. We map our analysis to focal areas in information security and examine it against Microsoft's own history, in order to determine the depth and breadth of Microsoft's innovations. Our analysis shows the relevance of using a network-based text analysis. Specifically, we find that Microsoft has increasingly emphasized topics that fall into the identity and access management area. We also show that Microsoft's innovations in information security showed tremendous growth after their Trustworthy Computing Initiative was announced. In addition, we are able to determine areas of focus that correspond to Microsoft's major vulnerabilities. These findings indicate that while Microsoft is still actively, albeit not always successfully, fighting vulnerabilities in their products, they are quite vigorously and broadly innovating in the information security area.}

This chapter identifies the limitations of the existing outsourcing literature and practices. This also outlines the requirements for an outsourcing framework. A clear appreciation of the objectives and risks of outsourcing is an essential pre-condition to the formation of suitable outsourcing performance measurements. According to a survey in 2006, the global business process outsourcing market was worth $48.4 billion for the first three quarters of 2006, representing a rise of 34% from the same period in 2005. Outsourcing can be employed to achieve performance improvements in cost, quality, service, and time-to-market. Examples of business services include computer services, professional services (legal, accountancy, market research, technical, engineering, advertising, human resources and consultancy), research and development (R&D), recruitment agencies and call centers. Between 1984 and 2001, the growth in the business services sector accounted for around one-third of the total output growth in the UK economy. A comprehensive survey of outsourcing in 2003 in the European banking industry by McKinsey, in collaboration with IBM and the EFMA, found that 44% of banks considered efficiency gains as the primary or even sole outsourcing objective. However, failure to place outsourcing within a strategic context will lead to a piecemeal approach based solely on attempts to reduce costs. Thus, a new focus on quality and customer relationships necessitates changes in policies, cultural values, work procedures and processes, relationship between departments and interactions between buyers and suppliers.}

abstract = {Interactions between epibiotic bacteria and organisms possibly play a central role in marine ecology. Despite its potential significance, this field has long time been neglected. For most aquatic taxa nothing is known about presence/absence of bacteria on their surface, much less about specific associations or potential interactions between epibiotically associated micro- and macroorganisms. Bahamian and Pacific ascidians, most of them colonial, were screened for the presence, abundance and diversity of epibiotic bacteria and macroepibionts. Only one species, Polyclinum planum, occasionally carried macroepibionts. All ascidian species exhibited varying densities of epibiotic bacteria on their surfaces. Average epibacterial abundance as assessed by plate counts on the 29 species ranged from 60 to 1.2 × 107/cm2. Significant differences in bacterial abundances were observed between species, families and geographical regions. On the family level, Polyclinidae were the most densely colonized. Bahamian species exhibited less dense epibacterial communities than Pacific species, a difference that may partly be caused by the absence of the heavily fouled Polyclinidae from the Bahamian collection. Diversity of culturable strains, evaluated for the Bahamian species only, was uniformly high on most species. I did not find any evidence for specific associations (as reflected by dominance of single strains) between culturable bacteria and ascidian species. Contrarily, direct observation by epifluorescence revealed the presence of an apparently dominant photosynthetic symbiont on several didemnid species. The presence of this symbiont correlated negatively with abundance and diversity of culturable epibionts. This negative correlation could reflect properties of the host's surface which selectively favor proliferation of the symbiont or antagonistic interactions between the symbionts and other potential bacterial colonizers.}

This chapter discusses various aspects of firewall. A firewall is a chokepoint from one network to another network. Firewalls are also being used to create chokepoints between other networks in an enterprise environment. Various information security studies and surveys have found that the majority of attacks come from inside an organization. Hackers attempt to discover systems and gather information. In most cases, these attacks are used to gather information to set up an access or a Denial of Service (DOS) attack. Phishing, the new information gathering technique, is spreading and becoming increasingly sophisticated. Phishing e-mails either ask the victim to fill out a form or directs them to a Web page designed to look like a legitimate banking site. Application proxy firewalls are written to the specifications of the particular applications, and the selection of a particular application proxy is mostly determined by the type of application server being protected. Fine control of application proxies is lost in favor of better performance. It is suggested that stateful inspection gateways can be used internally to further protect subnets, and filter the information coming in from the Internet.}

The effects of cholinergic drugs on this feedback system were assessed in order to verify the hypothesis that this mechanism is mediated via an intrastriatal cholinergic link. We presumed that DA receptors were located on a cholinergic neuron, while the cholinergic terminals in turn made direct or indirect axon-axonal contact with the dopaminergic nigro-striatal pathway (N.S.P.). Although cholinergic agents could modify the effect of HA-966 on striatal DA content, it proved to be impossible to counteract the blocking effect of apomorphine with cholinergic drugs as was to be expected. Therefore we concluded that the effect of apomorphine was not brought about in the way which had been postulated.}

Vegetational differences between this region and the north-west Mediterranean indicate that distinct latitudinal climatic gradients probably existed in the Mediterranean during the Pliocene-early Pleistocene.}

The species differ from each other in the developmental stage when pulsatile signaling first becomes evident. In D. discoideum, D. mucoroides, and D. purpureum pulsatile signal emission starts in the preaggregative field. In D. vinaceo-fuscum, D. mexicanum, P. violaceum, and P. pallidum the aggregation centers shifts from continuous to pulsatile secretion of chemoattractant during the aggregation process. In D. minutum pulsatile signaling starts after the completion of aggregation and slightly before the onset of culmination. Tip formation is a consequence of continued attraction of amoebae inside the aggregate to the center of signal emission. The occurrence of pulsatile signaling at an early stage of development is correlated with the capacity of the tip (signaling center) to organize a relatively large number of cells into a single fruiting body. Several lines of evidence suggest that cAMP is probably involved in the coordination of morphogenetic movement in the multicellular stage of all investigated species.}

This chapter provides technical methods and techniques to help practitioners extract and interpret data of investigative value from computers running Windows operating systems. An important aspect of conducting advanced forensic analysis is understanding the mechanisms underlying fundamental operations on Windows systems such as the boot process, file creation and deletion, and use of removable storage media. By understanding how to aggregate and correlate data on Windows systems, digital investigators are better able to get the “big picture” (such as an overall theory of user action and a timeline), as well as overcoming specific technical obstacles. It is not surprising that the majority of systems that digital investigators are called upon to examine run a Windows operating system. Whether investigating child pornography, intellectual property theft, or Internet Relay Chat (IRC) bot infection, it is a safe bet that knowledge of Windows operating systems, and its associated artifacts, will aid investigators in their task. It is important for forensic examiners to understand the Windows startup process for a number of reasons beyond simply interrupting the boot process to view and document the CMOS configuration. Ever since examiners figured out that there might be more to a file than meets the eye, they have been interested in Metadata, the information that describes or places data in context, without being part of the data that is the primary focus of the user. There are two types of metadata: file system metadata and application (or file) metadata.}

To better understand the impact of rapid releases on bug handling activity, we empirically analyze successive releases of the Eclipse Core projects, focusing on the bug handling rates and durations as well as the feature freeze period. We study the impact of Eclipse’s transition from a yearly to quarterly release cycle. We confirm our findings through feedback received from five Eclipse Core maintainers. Among others, our results reveal that Eclipse’s bug handling process is becoming more stable over time, with a decreasing number of reported bugs before releases, an increasing bug fixing rate and an increasingly balanced bug handling workload before and after releases. The transition to a quarterly release cycle continued to improve bug handling. In addition, more effort is spent on bug fixing during the feature freeze period, while the bug handling rates do not differ between both periods.}

This chapter describes the global impact of salinity and the consequences of elevated CO2 on plant growth and soil salinity. The cellular and whole plant mechanisms by which salinity affects growth are described, with emphasis on the mechanism by which elevated CO2 might interact with salinity. Much of the saline land in the world has been caused by human activities: by clearing, overgrazing, or the installation of irrigation schemes. The result of these activities is termed “secondary salinization.” The long-term productivity of the global agricultural system as a whole is declining, as is ecosystem stability. Rising CO2 levels could increase the productivity of cultivated species and natural vegetation on saline soils, but it may also increase soil salinity. Elevated CO2 can increase the growth rate of crops, pastures, and trees, but because it also increases their water use efficiency, it may alter the soil-plant water balance in a way that has adverse consequences for land with saline groundwater, where any factor that causes the water table to rise will increase the rate of salinization of the topsoil.}

These effects were not associated with induced chromosomal aberrations (Katoh et al., 1989) nor are they likely to be caused by gene mutations (Generoso et al., 1990). Nevertheless, the anomalies observed in these studies resemble the large class of stillbirths and sporadic defects in humans that are of unknown etiology, such as cleft palate, omphalocoel, clubfoot, hydrops and stillbirths (Czeizel, 1985; Oakley, 1986). Therefore, we continue to study the possible mechanisms relating to induction of these types of zygote-derived anomalies in mice. Effects of zygote exposure to the compounds methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), dimethyl sulfate (DMS), and diethyl sulfate (DES), which have similar DNA-binding properties as EtO and EMS, were studied. DMS and DES, but not MMS, induced effects that are similar to those induced by EtO and EMS. Thus, no site-specific alkylation product was identifiable as the critical target for these zygote-derived anomalies. We speculate that the developmental anomalies arose as a result of altered programming of gene expression during embryogenesis.}

abstract = {A single centre randomised placebo-controlled trial was performed to assess the 2-year effects of hormone replacement therapy compared to placebo on mechanical arterial properties in 99 perimenopausal women recruited from the general population. The trial was double-blind with respect to a sequential combined regimen of oral 17β-oestradiol and desogestrel (17βE2-D) and the placebo group and open with respect to combination of conjugated equine oestrogens and norgestrel (CEE-N). At baseline, distensibility and compliance of the common carotid artery were measured non-invasively with B-mode ultrasound and a vessel wall movement detector system, and the distensibility coefficient (DC) and compliance coefficient (CC) were calculated. Measurements were repeated after 6 and 24 months. Change in DC and CC in treatment groups was compared to placebo. After 24 months, changes for 17βE2-D compared to placebo were −1.4×10−3/kPa (95% CI −4.4; 1.7, P=0.39) for DC and 0.26 mm2/kPa (95% CI −0.01; 0.53, P=0.07) for CC. Changes for CEE-N compared to placebo were 0.4×10−3/kPa (95% CI −1.0; 1.9, P=0.79) and 0.11 mm2/kPa (95% CI −0.14; 0.37, P=0.40). For systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and arterial lumen diameter no changes were found. In this study no significant differences in changes in distensibility and compliance were found between perimenopausal women using 17βE2-D or CEE-N and women using placebo after 6 and 24 months.}
