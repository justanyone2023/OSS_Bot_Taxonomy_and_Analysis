abstract = {Code review is the process of inspecting code changes by a developer who is not involved in the development of the changeset. One of the initial and important steps of code review process is selecting code reviewer(s) for a given code change. To maximize the benefits of the code review process, the appropriate selection of the reviewer is essential. Code reviewer recommendation has been an active research area over the last few years, and many recommendation models have been proposed in the literature. In this study, we conduct a systematic literature review by inspecting 29 primary studies published from 2009 to 2020. Based on the outcomes of our review: (1) most preferred approaches are heuristic approaches closely followed by machine learning approaches, (2) the majority of the studies use open source projects to evaluate their models, (3) the majority of the studies prefer incremental training set validation techniques, (4) most studies suffer from reproducibility problems, (5) model generalizability and dataset integrity are the most common validity threats for the models and (6) refining models and conducting additional experiments are the most common future work discussions in the studies.}

This paper contributes to our understanding of an increasingly prevalent work system, web-based internet communities (WebICs). We are particularly interested in how WebICs are governed given the fact how different they are compared to more classical forms of organization. We study the governance of a WebIC by studying the structure and dynamics of their edit network. Given the fact that the edit network is a relational structure, social network analysis is key to understanding these work systems. We demonstrate that characteristics of the edit network contribute to predicting the dropout hazard of valuable WebIC members. Since WebICs exist only thanks to the activity of their contributors, predicting drop-outs becomes crucial. The results show that reputation and controversy have different effects for different types of Wikipedians; i.e., an actor’s reputation decreases the dropout hazard of active Wikipedians, while participation on controversial pages decreases the dropout hazard of highly active Wikipedians.}

abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) techniques are increasingly adopted to tackle ever-evolving high-profile network attacks, including Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), botnet, and ransomware, due to their unique ability to extract complex patterns hidden in data streams. These approaches are however routinely validated with data collected in the same environment, and their performance degrades when deployed in different network topologies and/or applied on previously unseen traffic, as we uncover. This suggests malicious/benign behaviors are largely learned superficially and ML-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) need revisiting, to be effective in practice. In this paper we dive into the mechanics of large-scale network attacks, with a view to understanding how to use ML for Network Intrusion Detection (NID) in a principled way. We reveal that, although cyberattacks vary significantly in terms of payloads, vectors and targets, their early stages, which are critical to successful attack outcomes, share many similarities and exhibit important temporal correlations. Therefore, we treat NID as a time-sensitive task and propose NetSentry, perhaps the first of its kind NIDS that builds on Bidirectional Asymmetric LSTM (Bi-ALSTM), an original ensemble of sequential neural models, to detect network threats before they spread. We cross-evaluate NetSentry using two practical datasets, training on one and testing on the other, and demonstrate F1 score gains above 33% over the state-of-the-art, as well as up to 3× higher rates of detecting attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and web bruteforce. Further, we put forward a novel data augmentation technique that boosts the generalization abilities of a broad range of supervised deep learning algorithms, leading to average F1 score gains above 35%. Lastly, we shed light on the feasibility of deploying NetSentry in operational networks, demonstrating affordable computational overhead and robustness to evasion attacks.}

abstract = {The extent to which Spartina alterniflora Loisel. fixes lacunar CO2 and utilizes dissolved inorganic carbon in the interstitial water of sediment was investigated, and the contribution of these two processes to total primary productivity was estimated and compared with photosynthesis in the leaf blades. Atmospheric CO2 is primarily fixed in the leaf blades, and the resultant assimilates are rapidly translocated through the leaf sheaths to the below ground tissues and growing points above ground. Lacunar CO2 is primarily fixed in the leaf sheaths and stem. The fact that these assimilates remain in the tissues around the lacunar spaces indicates that lacunar CO2 does not diffuse freely into the leaf blades but is recycled in the lacunar spaces. Dissolved inorganic carbon taken up by the plant from the sediment is primarily fixed by a dark reaction in the root tissues. Some dissolved inorganic carbon in the interstitial water may collect as gaseous CO2 in the lacunae and be fixed in the leaf sheaths and stem. In addition, dissolved inorganic carbon may be taken up in the transpiration stream and be fixed in the leaf blades by photosynthesis. However, internal CO2 fixation and dissolved inorganic carbon utilization together are only about 10% of the rate of fixation of atmospheric CO2 by leaves.}

Distributed control architectures have the potential to achieve greater flexibility by being capable of local decision making based on real time reasoning. One of the main challenges of these distributed architectures is represented by the capability to synchronize the production data across all execution points in a reliable and consistent fashion. In this context, this paper aims to resolve the problems associated with real time production data synchronization in distributed multi-agent control systems by proposing a common dataset synchronized across all agent entities using multicast network communication. On top of this common dataset approach, an agent negotiation mechanism is proposed that addresses the operation sequencing and resource allocation in decentralized operation model. The pilot implementation is using JADE multi agent platform and JGroups for real time data synchronization and NetLogo for abstract representation of the simulation system. Experimental results gathered from the pilot implementation are discussed.}

Many guidelines for ethical and responsible computing have been developed in response. Dominant approaches typically attribute liability and blame to individual companies or actors, rather than understanding how the working practices, norms, and cultural understandings in the software industry contribute to such outcomes. In this paper, we propose an understanding of responsibility that is infrastructural, relational, and cultural; thus, providing a foundation to better enable responsible software engineering into the future. Our approach draws on Young's (2006) social connection model of responsibility and Star and Ruhleder's (1994) concept of infrastructure. By bringing these theories together we introduce a concept called infrastructural injustice, which offers a new way for software engineers to consider their opportunities for responsible action with respect to society and the planet. We illustrate the utility of this approach by applying it to an Open-Source software communities’ development of Deepfake technology, to find key leverage points of responsibility that are relevant to both Deepfake technology and software engineering more broadly.}

Because wetland macrophytes are directly influenced by water quality, any impairment in wetland quality should be reflected by taxonomic composition of the aquatic plant community. We developed a wetland macrophyte index (WMI) with plant presence/absence data for 127 coastal wetlands (154 wetland-years) from all five Great Lakes, using results of a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to ordinate plant species along a water quality gradient (CCA axis 1). We validated the WMI with data collected before and after the implementation of remedial actions plans (RAPs) in Sturgeon Bay (Severn Sound) and Cootes Paradise Marsh. Consistent with predictions, WMI scores for Sturgeon Bay were significantly higher after the implementation of the RAP. Historical data from Cootes Paradise Marsh were used to track the declining condition of the plant community from the 1940s to 1990s. Subsequently, when remedial actions had been implemented in 1997, the calculated WMI scores showed improvement, but when the presence of exotic species (WMIadj) was accounted for, improvements in ecological integrity of the aquatic-plant community were no longer evident. We show how WMI scores can be used by environmental agencies to assess the historic, current, and future ecological status of wetland ecosystems in two Canadian national parks, Point Pelee National Park (PPNP) and Fathom Five National Marine Park (FFNMP).}

In this context, changes in the monthly weather pattern serve only to outline the growth conditions due to the nonlinearity of response of shrubs to climatic factors. The plant-soil-atmosphere system is described by means of ordinary non-linear differential equations for the state variables: green biomass, woody biomass, the residues of green and woody biomasses, faecal detritus of mammals on the soil, and the total organic matter of the soil. The behaviour of the flow variables is described by means of equations obtained from non-linear multiple regressions from the state variables and the input variables. The model has been applied with success to the behaviour of Cistus albidus in two zones of the Province of Alicante (Spain). The data base for the parametrical locations (zone 1) and validation (zone 2) is based upon measurements taken weekly over a 2-year period. The model is used to simulate the response of this shrub to a decreasing tendency in precipitation combined with a simultaneous rise in temperature. A period of 10 years is simulated and it is observed that plants with woody biomass smaller than 85 g die between the first and the third month and other plants' biomass decreases during this period, and strongly thereafter.}

Previous research on Wikipedia has shown that widespread participation, coupled with the principle of neutrality of viewpoint, has led to ‘editing wars’ and associated high coordination costs. The question that we address is therefore that of how to analyse the interactive dynamics of conflictual OEC discussions. To address this issue, we performed a longitudinal analysis of a specific case-study within the French-speaking “astronomy” Wikipedia OEC, revolving around the renaming of the article on the celestial body “Pluto”, given the ‘descent’ of its scientific status from that of a planet to an asteroid. Our choice was to focus on the analysis of dialogic and epistemic roles, as an appropriate meso-level unit of analysis. We present a qualitative-quantitative method for analysis of roles, based on filtering major participants and analysing the dialogic functions and epistemic contents of their communicative acts. Our analyses showed that online epistemic communities can be communities in the true sense of their involving cooperation, in that roles become gradually specialised and reciprocal over sequences of the discussion: when one participant changes role from one sequence to another, other participants ‘fill in’ for the vacant role. Secondly, we show that OECs, in the case of Wikipedia, do not function purely on a knowledge-level, but also involve, crucially, negotiation of images of participants’ competences with respect to the knowledge domain. In that sense, OECs can be seen as socio-cognitive communities. The originality of our research resides in the qualitative-quantitative method for analysing interactive roles, and the results of its application to an extended longitudinal case study.}

SIN-1, isolated in India from root nodules on the tropical legume Sesbania aculeata, also induces nitrogen-fixing nodules on roots of S. macrocarpa, S. speciosa, S. procumbens, S. punicea, S. rostrata, and Vigna unguiculata. Unlike Azorhizobium caulinodans, SIN-1 does not induce stem nodules on S. rostrata. The nodules induced by SIN-1 develop exclusively at the bases of secondary roots. Electron microscopic studies of mature nodule sections revealed rhizobia within intercellular spaces, indicating a ‘crack entry’ mechanism of root infection. SIN-1 is a fast-growing, acid-producing, salt-tolerant Rhizobium that utilizes a wide variety of carbon sources. The nodulation (nod) genes of this strain are located on a 300-MDa symbiosis (sym) plasmid. Fatty acid profile and sequence comparison of a 260-bp conserved region of the 16S rRNA gene demonstrated that SIN-1 is phylogenetically closely related to R. galegae, a species that nodulates temperate legumes.}

abstract = {Context:
The modern code review process is an integral part of the current software development practice. Considerable effort is given here to inspect code changes, find defects, suggest an improvement, and address the suggestions of the reviewers. In a code review process, several iterations usually take place where an author submits code changes and a reviewer gives feedback until is happy to accept the change. In around 12% cases, the changes are abandoned, eventually wasting all the efforts.
Objective:
In this research, our objective is to design a tool that can predict whether a code change would be merged or abandoned at an early stage to reduce the waste of efforts of all stakeholders (e.g., program author, reviewer, project management, etc.) involved. The real-world demand for such a tool was formally identified by a study by Fan et al. (2018).
Method:
We have mined 146,612 code changes from the code reviews of three large and popular open-source software and trained and tested a suite of supervised machine learning classifiers, both shallow and deep learning-based. We consider a total of 25 features in each code change during the training and testing of the models. The features are divided into five dimensions: reviewer, author, project, text, and code.
Results:
The best performing model named PredCR (Predicting Code Review), a LightGBM-based classifier achieves around 85% AUC score on average and relatively improves the state-of-the-art (Fan et al., 2018) by 14%–23%. In our extensive empirical study involving PredCR on the 146,612 code changes from the three software projects, we find that (1) The new features like reviewer dimensions that are introduced in PredCR are the most informative. (2) Compared to the baseline, PredCR is more effective towards reducing bias against new developers. (3) PredCR uses historical data in the code review repository and as such the performance of PredCR improves as a software system evolves with new and more data.
Conclusion:
PredCR can help save time and effort by helping developers/code reviewers to prioritize the code changes that they are asked to review. Project management can use PredCR to determine how code changes can be assigned to the code reviewers (e.g., select code changes that are more likely to be merged for review before the changes that might be abandoned).}

The Canarian laurel forest ecosystem is composed of several co-dominant evergreen tree species including Ilex perado, I. canariensis, Myrica faya, Laurus azorica, and Persea indica. With leaves of these trees the diurnal course of stress parameters (chlorophyll fluorescence Fv/Fm, pigments, ascorbate, glutathione, gas exchange, water relations) was investigated during a mildly stressful summer day. Sun leaves generally had lower photochemical efficiencies (morning Fv/Fm in sun leaves were below 0.80 and above 0.80 in shade leaves), less chlorophyll, a larger xanthophyll cycle pool per unit chlorophyll, and more glutathione and ascorbate. Minimal relative water contents of more than 85% indicated that dehydration was not a stress factor. Stomatal conductances decreased from 150 to 200 mmol H2O m−2 s−1 in the morning to about 50 mmol H2O m−2 s−1 during the day in all species, but this did not limit CO2 uptake. De-epoxidation of xanthophylls only occurred in sun leaves of I. canariensis (to more than 50%) and M. faya (more than 60%). Decrea Fv/Fm were only found in sun leaves of P. indica (from ca. 0.80 in the morning to a minimum of 0.70) and, as a trend, also in L. azorica (from ca. 0.75 to ca. 0.65). I. perado showed neither of those responses. P. indica and L. azorica exhibited the highest photosynthesis rates of about 10 μmol CO2 m−2 s−1 compared to 8 in the other species. The photoprotection strategy of P. indica and L. azorica admitted slow recovery from photoinhibition, did not activate protective energy dissipation through xanthophylls, and allowed highest production under these typical conditions.}

Himalaya (C.I. 620) barley seeds were adjusted to water contents ranging from 2 to 10%, irradiated with 60Co γ-rays, and soaked at 0°C in distilled water bubbled with oxygen-nitrogen gas mixtures containing 0.0, 3.1, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 100% oxygen. Biological effects of the treatments were recorded as M1 seedling injury. Essentially no oxygen enhancement of biological damage was obtained with an oxygen concentration of 3.1% in the gas phase of the soaking solution. The minimum OCHG needed to cause an oxygen enhancement of biological damage (3.1% OCHG) increased with increasing seed water content between 1.8 and 10.0%, and decreased as the radiation dose increased, suggesting a triple factor interaction. For moderate levels of injury (between 20 and 60%), a nearly linear increase in seedling injury was obtained when the OCHG was increased in an exponential fashion. For greater seedling injury, the response tended toward a sigmoid shaped curve, probably due to limitations of the biological parameter. The same types of response were obtained when the results were analyzed in terms of oxygen enhancement ratios (OER) obtained from seedling injury data. Decreases in oxygen-independent radiosensitivity, determined by the increase in radiation exposure required to induce 40% injury with anaerobic soakings, were obtained as the seed water content was increased from 2.0 to 9.9%. The same pattern of radiosensitivity was observed with aerobic soakings and was more pronounced at intermediate levels of OCHG. The change in radiosensitivity of seeds between seed water contents of 2.0 and 7.7% was consistent with published EPR data. The increase in response at intermediate OCHG was in part a reflection of the influence of seed water content on the level of OCHG needed to produce an oxygen enhancement of damage. Cooling seeds of 6.1% water content to dry ice temperatures immediately after irradiation at 0°C decreased both oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent damage. The decreases in damage were greater at 20 krad than at 10 krad and tended to be greater at the higher OCHG.}

Especially hollow structures made of braided hybrid yarn hoses offer a high application potential as the unconsolidated hoses provide a good drapability and thus allow the fabrication of complex shaped torsion- and bend-resistant structures. At present, the shaping and preforming of braided hoses is usually performed manually. To enable a high volume production of lightweight hollow structures, automated preforming technologies are required. This article discusses a new technical approach which allows a fully automated preforming of braided hybrid yarn hoses. Starting with pre-fabricated and rolled up quasi-endless braided hoses, the conceived automation system has to cut several segments from the hose and subsequently pull them above each other to produce a multi-ply preform. For an automated process, a reproducible and damage-free manipulation of the hoses has to be ensured during preforming. Therefore, the process is analyzed and concepts for unrolling and cutting of the endless hoses as well as stacking and fixation of the obtained segments are developed and evaluated experimentally. As a result of the investigation, a fully automated preforming station is built up.}

For more than two decades, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been an important tool for the protection of networks and information systems. However, applying traditional IDS techniques to IoT is difficult due to its particular characteristics such as constrained-resource devices, specific protocol stacks, and standards. In this paper, we present a survey of IDS research efforts for IoT. Our objective is to identify leading trends, open issues, and future research possibilities. We classified the IDSs proposed in the literature according to the following attributes: detection method, IDS placement strategy, security threat and validation strategy. We also discussed the different possibilities for each attribute, detailing aspects of works that either propose specific IDS schemes for IoT or develop attack detection strategies for IoT threats that might be embedded in IDSs.}

Reduction in Fv/Fm was associated with an increase in instantaneous (F0) and a decrease in maximum (Fm) fluorescence, indicating perturbation by the UV-B exposure of more than one photosynthetic site.

Little is known about the factors that regulate or affect this transition in wheat and other graminae. Because ethephon is known to accelerate this transition in other plants, the effect of seed treatment on spring wheat growth and development was investigated. Seedlings derived from seeds imbibed in ethephon underwent the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth earlier than seeds imbibed in water. The percentage of 17-day-old plants with four fully-emerged leaves (i.e., plants in which meristem development had proceeded from vegetative apex to double-ridge formation) showed a positive correlation with ethephon concentration. Subsequent yield components were unaffected with the exception of a small increase in the number of kernels/spike in plants derived from seeds imbibed in ethephon solutions for 24 h. Neither root nor shoot dry weights of 21-day-old plants were affected by the treatments. Germination percentages were unaffected by the treatments but 8-day-old plants derived from seeds imbibed for 24 h had reduced height with increasing ethephon concentrations. These results will be useful in further studies of the biochemical basis of the transition to reproductive growth.}

Seeds were adjusted to water contents of 2–14% by storage in vacuum desiccators over calcium oxide or mixtures of glycerol and water and then irradiated in vacuo or under various oxygen tensions with 60Co gamma rays. After irradiation, the seeds were soaked at approximately 0°C in oxygen or nitrogen bubbled water. Treatment effects were recorded as M1 seedling injury. Seeds exposed to HPO before, during or after irradiation followed by soaking in oxygen or nitrogen expressed two or three times more damage than irradiation in vacuo followed by soaking in oxygenated water. That a reaction between oxygen and radiation-induced sites probably occurs before the seeds are soaked was demonstrated by the failure to remove completely the effect of HPO by vacuum between HPO treatment and irradiation. The results indicate that placing the seeds under HPO may increase the rate and extent of reactions which occur during post-radiation storage of seeds in the presence of oxygen. The increase in damage associated with oxygen soaking (oxygen-dependent damage) is partially lost during aerobic storage and is largely pre-empted when seeds are placed under HPO. This decrease in oxygen-dependent damage is accompanied by an increase in damage occurring with nitrogen soaking, suggesting that the reaction which leads to damage was initiated before soaking and to the same oxygen sensitive sites.}

The cardinal role of chronic inflammation in the development of atherosclerosis is increasingly being recognized. Estrogens may prevent the evolution of atherosclerosis by suppressing immune response. Furthermore, the conflicting reports on the cardiovascular effects of hormone therapy between observational and clinical trials have triggered interest on the effect of alternative therapies on the cardiovascular system.
Objective
The aim of this study was to assess the effect of estrogen, estrogen–progestin, tibolone and raloxifene therapy on circulating markers of chemotaxis in healthy postmenopausal women.
Methods
Eighty-eight postmenopausal women aged 44–62 years were randomly allocated to daily: (1) conjugated equine estrogens 0.625mg (CEE), (2) 17β-estradiol 1mg plus norethisterone acetate 0.5mg (E2/NETA), (3) tibolone 2.5mg, (4) raloxifene HCl 60mg or (5) no treatment. Serum monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) were measured at baseline and at 3 months.
Results
Endogenous testosterone and free androgen index (FAI) correlated negatively, while SHBG correlated positively with serum RANTES (testosterone: r=−0.27, p=0.033; FAI: r=−0.43, p=0.004: SHBG: r=0.34, p=0.026). Serum MCP-1 decreased significantly in the CEE group (baseline 125.3±51pg/ml, 3 months 84.5±36.1pg/ml, p=0.043), while no difference was detected between baseline and post-treatment levels in the other groups. Furthermore, a significant decrease in serum RANTES was observed at the end of 3 months only in the E2/NETA and the raloxifene group (E2/NETA baseline 8690.6±3880.0pg/ml, 3 months 6894.0±1720.0pg/ml, p=0.007; raloxifene baseline 9042.4±3765.6pg/ml, 3 months 6718.1±2366.2pg/ml, p=0.011).
Conclusion
Endogenous androgens may suppress chemotactic response. Postmenopausal hormone therapy and raloxifene may inhibit the expression of chemoattractant molecules and thus attenuate inflammation. The relevance of these findings in terms of clinically established caridoprotection remains to be clarified.}

A cellular automaton is viewed as simple models of spatially extended decentralized systems made up of a number of individual components (e.g. biological cells). The communication between constituent cells is limited to local interaction. Each individual cell is in a specific state, which changes over time depending on the states of its local neighbors. In particular, cellular automaton models have been proposed for biological applications, including ecological, epidemiological, ethological (game theoretical), evolutionary, immunobiological and morphogenetic aspects. The chapter discusses an overview of cellular automaton models of spatio-temporal pattern formation in interacting cell systems. Various automaton rules mimicking general pattern forming principles have been suggested, and may lead to models of (intracellular) cytoskeleton and membrane dynamics, tissue formation, tumor growth, life cycles of micro-organisms or animal coat markings. Automaton models of cellular pattern formation can be roughly classified according to the prevalent type of interaction. Cell-medium interactions dominate (nutrient-dependent) growth models, while one can further distinguish direct cell-cell and indirect cell-medium-cell interactions. Finally, the chapter focuses on a specific example—tippling pattern formation in myxobacteria and introduce a cellular automaton model for this phenomenon, which is able to lead to testable biological hypotheses.}

I provide checklists for researchers setting up such experiments to help improve data quality. These recommendations focus on three key aspects of experimental design: the technology choices made by researchers and participants, participant recruitment methods, and the performance of participants during experiments.

Rye secalins have been separated using preparative Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in gradient gels. Fractionated secalin was recovered by solvent extraction. Based on the recovery of unfractionated secalin from the entire gel, nearly quantitative recovery of cereal prolamins is possible. However, the yield of purified secalin constituents was typically about 75 %. The procedure has been used to prepare milligram quantities of individual secalin bands or fractions. The method and equipment described are simple and can be applied for the fractionation of prolamins from other cereal grains. To demonstrate the general usefulness of the method, wheat gliadins and barley hordeins have been fractionated. Experimental conditions can readily be modified to enhance prolamin resolution. The procedure can probably be adapted to provide purified components equivalent to most of the prolamin bands visible in one- or two-dimensional PAGE patterns.}

Even so, this is a time-consuming procedure that may increase the incidence of difficult transfers by removing the naturally lubricant mucus. In addition, any cervical manipulations at the time of embryo transfer may cause unwarranted uterine contractions. In this prospective, controlled study, 286 women undergoing embryo transfer between January and May 2006 were divided into two groups according to whether the cervical mucus was scheduled to be aspirated (group A) or not (group B). The two groups were similar with regards to the demographics, cause of infertility, characteristics of ovarian stimulation and embryos transferred. Even so, the clinical pregnancy rate was significantly higher in group (A) than group (B) (OR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.32–3.58), although there were easier transfers in group (B) than group (A) (OR = 3.00, 95% CI = 1.05–8.55). This demonstrates that even though embryo transfers were easier to perform when the cervical mucus was left in place, aspiration resulted in an increased chance of clinical pregnancy.}

The above-ground biomass of seagrass within sampling quadrats was ranked with respect to a set of reference quadrats which were preselected to provide a scale of standing crop dry weights. At the end of each sampling period, sufficient quadrats were harvested to calibrate the scale. Using the method, monthly mean standing crops were estimated from May 1987 to April 1988 for a multispecific seagrass bed on Green Island, North Queensland. Values obtained ranged between 61.52 and 113.08 g dry weight m−2. The precision (SE/x) of each monthly estimate ranged from 0.05 to 0.13, a satisfactory level for field programs. This method is more precise and time efficient, and is less destructive than some traditional harvesting methods.}

Electroncytochemical study of control cells cultivated at 1 g revealed that granular precipitate marked chloroplasts, mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, lipid drops, nucleoplasma, nucleolus, nucleus membranes, cell walls and endoplasmic reticulum. In mitochondria the precipitate was revealed in stroma, in chloroplast it was found on thylakoids and envelope membranes. The cultivation of protonema on clinostat led to the intensification in cytochemical reaction product deposit. A considerable intensification of the reaction was noted in endomembranes, vacuoles, periplasmic space and cell walls. At the same time analysis of pectinase localization was made using the electroncytochemical method. A high reaction intensity in walls in comparison to that in control was found out to be a distinctive pecularity of the cells cultivated on clinostat. It testifies to the fact that increasing of freee calcium concentrations under conditions of clinostation is connected with pectinic substances hydrolysis and breaking of methoxy groups of pectins. Data obtained are discussed in relation to problems of possible mechanisms of disturbance in calcium balance of plant cells and the role of cell walls in gomeostasis of cell grown under conditions of simulated weighlessness.}

abstract = {The prediction of phase separation is essential to understand and control the properties of food systems. In this work, an existing theoretical model for describing phase separation between binary mixtures of hydrocolloids, using a virial approach up to second order, is extended with several new analytical expressions. These new expressions allow one to determine the three virial coefficients directly from three characteristics of the phase diagram, where the critical point plays a pivotal role and allows one to predict the complete phase diagram. The advantage of this approach is that experimental techniques, like membrane osmometry or static light scattering, to directly measure virial coefficients can be, in principle, avoided. It was found that just the location of the critical point is sufficient to determine two of the three virial coefficients, when one of the virial coefficients is known. When, in addition to the critical point, one other characteristic of the phase diagram is known with sufficient accuracy, like the slope of the tie-lines near or far away from the critical point, all three virial coefficients can be determined from the phase diagram. Using this approach, three virial coefficients for aqueous mixtures of dextran and polyethylene oxide were determined and compared to the ones obtained from membrane osmometry.}

We investigated the relation of Lp(a) plasma levels to endothelium dependent and independent dilatation of the brachial artery in healthy postmenopausal women. Methods. One hundred and five healthy postmenopausal women aged 52–67 years were included in the study. Endothelial function was assessed non-invasively by measuring percent lumen diameter change in the brachial artery after reactive hyperemia and sublingual nitroglycerine spray. Results. Flow mediated dilatation was inversely related to the plasma logLp(a) level. Mean change per unit logLp(a) increase:−2.83% (95% CI: −5.22–−0.43). Elevated Lp(a) (>239 mg/l) (upper quartile) was associated with an impaired flow mediated vasodilatation (2.4%±1.2) compared to Lp(a) ≤239 mg/l (5.2%±0.7). Adjustment for other cardiovascular risk factors did not change the magnitude of the association. Nitroglycerine-induced vasodilatation was not significantly lower in the high Lp(a) level group, compared to the group with normal levels of Lp(a) (≤239 mg/l) (8.0±1.2 vs 11.4%±0.8). Conclusion. Elevated lipoprotein (a) levels are associated with an impaired endothelial function in healthy postmenopausal women, independent of conventional risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Since Lp(a) may be pathogenetically important for early vascular damage, elevated Lp(a) levels might contribute to the increased cardiovascular risk seen in postmenopausal women.}

The possibility of becoming a victim of cyber crime is the number-one fear of billions of people. This concern is well founded. The findings in the annual CSI/FBI Computer Crime and Security Surveys confirm that cyber crime is real and continues to be a significant threat. Traceback and attribution are performed during or after cyber violations and attacks, to identify where an attack originated, how it propagated, and what computer(s) and person(s) are responsible and should be held accountable. The goal of network forensics capabilities is to determine the path from a victimized network or system through any intermediate systems and communication pathways, back to the point of attack origination or the person who is accountable. In some cases, the computers launching an attack may themselves be compromised hosts or be controlled remotely. Attribution is the process of determining the identity of the source of a cyber attack. Types of attribution can include both digital identity (computer, user account, IP address, or enabling software) and physical identity (the actual person using the computer from which an attack originated). Cyber crime has become a painful side effect of the innovations of computer and Internet technologies. With the growth of the Internet, cyber attacks and crimes are happening every day and everywhere. It is very important to build the capability to trace and attribute attacks to the real cyber criminals and terrorists, especially in this large-scale human-built networked environment. In this chapter, we discuss the current network forensic techniques in cyber attack traceback. We focus on the current schemes in IP spoofing traceback and stepping-stone attack attribution. Furthermore, we introduce the traceback issues in Voice over IP, Botmaster, and online fraudsters.}

In this paper, we present a survey of security issues in terms of security threats and their remediations. The contribution aims at the analysis and categorization of working mechanisms of the main security issues and the possible solutions that exist in the literature. We perform a parametric comparison of the threats being faced by cloud platforms. Moreover, we compare various intrusion detection and prevention frameworks being used to address security issues. The trusted cloud computing and mechanisms for regulating security compliance among cloud service providers are also analyzed. Since the security mechanisms continue to evolve, we also present the future orientation of cloud security issues and their possible countermeasures.}

The theory is given of hydrophobic interactions at a macroscopic level, as well as various methods for their quantitative measurement. The properties of hydrophobic, partly hydrophobic and hydrophilic compounds and surfaces are described, including those of amino acids, proteins (incorporating protein solubility), proteins at the air-water interface, carbohydrates, phospholipids, phospholipid layers, and nucleic acids. Finally, some effects and applications of hydrophobic interactions are discussed, including protein adsorption, protein precipitation, cell adhesion, cell fusion, and liquid chromatography approaches such as reversed-phase and hydrophobic interaction chromatography.

These proteins affected the [bacterium-medium-casing]system in several ways. They interacted with the cell wall surface, making it more positively charged, they lowered the surface tension of the adhesion medium, and they decreased the hydrophobicity of the casing. Reduction of bacterial adhesion appeared to be mostly related to the decrease in casing hydrophobicity and, indeed, the proteins which did not reduce adhesion (gelatin or casamino acids) had no effect on casing hydrophobicity. The fact that collagen reduced adhesion without affecting the casing surface free energy is consistent with the previous report that some lactobacilli can specifically bind to collagen through a receptor-adhesion site interaction.}

In FFSNs, the machines rapidly change such that blacklisting them does not entirely stop the networks from operating the websites. This increases the longevity of the websites thus becoming more harmful. Existing solutions for detecting the websites are limited with relatively low or moderate prediction performances, high prediction time and use of less diversified features which increases their susceptibility to detection evasions. This paper proposes a Machine Learning (ML) based approach for detecting phishing websites hosted in FFSNs using a novel set of 56 features. Compared with previous works, the approach achieves high accuracy, a low detection time and uses highly diversified features to enhance resilience to detection evasion. The effectiveness of the features for prediction was evaluated in the context of binary and multi-class classification tasks using multiple traditional and deep learning ML algorithms. The proposed approach achieves an accuracy of 98.42% and 97.81% for binary and multi-class classification tasks respectively. Our results showed that temporal and DNS based features are the strongest predictors while network and host related features are the weakest. Our approach is a significant step towards tracking of core components of FFSNs with an aim of shutting down the entire phishing ecosystem.}

The ACGME requires the assessment of resident competency in 6 domains. Global evaluations covering all 6 competencies are routinely used. Evaluators may be overly influenced by resident affability and availability, thereby resulting in a halo effect. We hypothesized that the Interpersonal Skills and Communications (ICS) and Professionalism (PR) competencies would unduly influence other competency scores.
Methods
General surgery resident evaluations are performed by staff and peers on a rotational basis using competency-based questions. Each question is scored using a 5-point Likert scale. Mean individual composite scores for each competency were calculated and then correlated with other mean composite competency scores. Data from patient evaluations were similarly analyzed. A final correlation of competency scores to ABSITE scores, as an objective, standardized measure of a specific competency, Medical knowledge (MK) was also performed.
Results
Results were available for 37 residents (PGY 1-5). There was a significant association between ICS scores and higher scores in MK (r = 0.52, p = 0.004), PR (r = 0.826, p < 0.0001) and patient care (PC) (r = 0.619, p < 0.0001). No correlation, however, was found between patient evaluations of residents and their faculty/peer-based ICS scores. We found no association between ICS scores and improved patient evaluations. Lastly, we found no association between ICS or MK scores and ABSITE scores.
Conclusions
It was difficult to ascertain whether residents with better ICS scores had higher PR, PC, and MK scores because of the halo effect, improper completion of evaluations, or whether those residents were truly performing better clinically. External measures of resident performance did not correlate with faculty/peer evaluations of ICS and PR. Residency programs should consider adopting a more standardized way to objectively evaluate residents.}

Both field and laboratory plants showed a low affinity for inorganic carbon (CO2 compensation points ranging from 0.7 to 22 μM, and K0.5(CO2) from 51 to 121 μM), consistent with C-3 photosynthesis and use of CO2 alone. Variation in inorganic carbon uptake characteristics was low in both groups of plants. Only in laboratory-grown plants was a coupling found between carbon uptake and the inorganic carbon regime of the medium. The carbon extraction capacity, expressed as a percentage of the initial amount of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) assimilated in PH-drift experiments, increased from −1.4 to 11.8% with declining external carbon availability, and the initial slope of the CO2 response curve increased from 6.4 to 15.3 g−1 h−1 dm3. The plasticity of the inorganic carbon uptake system of C. cophocarpa was very low compared to the plasticity observed for submerged macrophytes with accessory carbon uptake systems (i.e. HCO3− use or C-4 photosynthesis), suggesting that the plasticity of the C-3 photosynthetic apparatus as such is restricted. The low carbon affinity of C. cophocarpa indicates that this species depends on CO2 oversaturation for a sufficient supply of CO2 for photosynthesis and growth.}

Design: A single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Setting: Research center as part of the University Medical Center Utrecht. Subjects: One hundred and five healthy postmenopausal women, sampled from the general population. Interventions: Three months treatment with tibolone or CEE+MPA or placebo. Main outcome measure: At baseline and after 3 months, endothelial function was assessed non-invasively by measuring percent lumen diameter change in the brachial artery after reactive hyperemia and sublingual nitroglycerine spray. Results: Results are presented as mean differences between treatment groups of endothelium dependent flow mediated dilatation (fmd) and endothelium independent nitroglycerine induced dilatation with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). After treatment, there was a significant difference in mean fmd between the CEE+MPA group and the placebo group of 2.5% (95% CI: 0.3–4.6) while the tibolone group and the placebo group did not differ significantly (0.6%; 95% CI: 1.6–2.8). Nitroglycerine induced dilatation did not differ significantly between the groups. Conclusions: Hormone replacement therapy with CEE+MPA for 3 months increases endothelium dependent fmd of the brachial artery in healthy postmenopausal women. Tibolone did not alter fmd. The clinical significance of this improvement in fmd for cardiovascular disease risk needs to be established.}

The possibility of becoming a victim of cyber-crime is the number-one fear of billions of people. This concern is well founded. The findings in the annual Computer Security Institute/Federal Bureau of Investigation Computer Crime and Security Surveys confirm that cyber-crime is real and continues to be a significant threat. Trace-back and attribution are performed during or after cyber violations and attacks to identify where an attack originated, how it propagated, and what computer(s) and person(s) are responsible and should be held accountable. The goal of network forensics capabilities is to determine the path from a victimized network or system through any intermediate systems and communication pathways, back to the point of attack origination or the person who is accountable. In some cases, the computers launching an attack may themselves be compromised hosts or be controlled remotely. Attribution is the process of determining the identity of the source of a cyber-attack. Types of attribution can include both digital identity [computer, user account, Internet Protocol (IP) address, or enabling software] and physical identity (the actual person using the computer from which an attack originated). Cyber-crime has become a painful side effect of the innovations of computer and Internet technologies. With the growth of the Internet, cyber-attacks and crimes are happening every day and everywhere. It is very important to build the capability to trace and attribute attacks to the real cyber criminals and terrorists, especially in this large-scale human-built networked environment. In this chapter, we discuss the current network forensic techniques in cyber-attack trace-back. We focus on the current schemes in IP spoofing trace-back and stepping-stone attack attribution. Furthermore, we introduce the trace-back issues in Voice over Internet Protocol, botmaster, and online fraudsters.}

However, there has been no study on the tools to understand better what is available and what is missing. For this paper we analyzed almost 800 articles from pertinent venues from 2014 to 2019 to answer the following three questions (1) what tools (i.e., in which domains of digital forensics): have been released; (2) are they still available, maintained, and documented; and (3) are there possibilities to enhance the status quo? We found 62 different tools which we categorized according to digital forensics subfields. Only 33 of these tools were found to be publicly available, the majority of these were not maintained after development. In order to enhance the status quo, one recommendation is a centralized repository specifically for tested tools. This will require tool researchers (developers) to spend more time on code documentation and preferably develop plugins instead of stand-alone tools.}

Methods: Hundred-and-five healthy postmenopausal women, aged 50–65 years, were treated with 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) combined with 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) (CEE+MPA), 2.5 mg tibolone or placebo for 3 months. At baseline and after 3 months, endothelial function was assessed using flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and nitro glycerine-mediated dilatation (NMD). Furthermore, lipids were measured. Multivariate linear regression analysis was applied to address the research question. Results: Treatment with CEE+MPA resulted in an improvement in FMD of 2.0% (95% CI: −0.1; 4.1). CEE/MPA reduced total cholesterol with 13% (95% CI: −18%; −7%), LDL-cholesterol with 23% (95% CI: −30%; −15%) and lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) with 14% (95% CI: −26%; −2%). The magnitude of the relation of CEE/MPA with endothelial function was attenuated to from 2.0 to 1.6% when change in Lp(a) was taken into account. Adjustments for other lipids or blood pressure did not attenuate the association. Conclusions: The improvement in endothelial function in postmenopausal women treated with CEE+MPA appears to be partially mediated by change in Lp(a), and apparently not by changes in other lipids.}

abstract = {Measurements of the following parameters were made over a 4 year period in 10- to 14-year-old stands of Pinus radiata subjected to markedly different degrees of water and nitrogen (N) stress: needle length, weight and specific leaf area (every 2 weeks), foliage biomass production (annually), pre-dawn needle water potential (every 2 weeks) and needle litter N concentration (monthly). Increments in needle length were a useful estimate of increments in needle weight for any given forest treatment and year because there was no consistent variation in weight per unit length of needles as they developed during the growing season. However, for well-illuminated needles, the ratio of weight per unit of needle length showed a large (approximately two-fold) variation attributable to treatment and year of foliage elongation. The ratio was loosely positively correlated with needle length (or the favourability of growing conditions) on non-irrigated plots, and appeared to result largely from increases in needle thickness rather than density. Final needle length, ranging between 40 and 160 mm, depended mainly on the amount of water and N stress experienced by trees during the growing season. The majority (greater than 90%) of needle extension occurred during a 4 month period (October–January) in spring and summer and the pattern of needle growth was affected only by water availability. Needle extension rates were negatively linearly correlated with the water stress integral (Sψ, a temporal integration of the effects of both water and N availability on needle water potentials) for monthly periods during the growing season. Needle extension, was most sensitive to the Sψ in mid-spring (October/November) when needles were elongating rapidly and still less than one-half grown. About 80% of the variation in annual foliage production (3.2–8.5 t ha−1) could be explained in terms of both (a) Sψ during the previous summer (when primordia were initiated), and (b) the water and N status of trees concurrent with needle extension. Final needle length and total foliage biomass production in the same year were poorly correlated. The specific leaf area (SLA, all sides) ranged from 10 to 17 m2 kg−1 and was greater for needles formed under low light. Irrigation or fertilisation had only an indirect effect on SLA by hastening canopy closure.}

Then, the thermal designing problem of the furnace was formulated as a multiobjective nonlinear optimization problem by investigating two objective functions; that is, (a) minimization of the! sum of the insulator's thickness, and (b) minimization of the total heat loss from the furnace. By adopting both the weighting method and the generalized reduced gradient algorithm, the set of Pare to optimal solutions was derived by determining the thickness of the heat insulator at each cell.

This study was aimed to develop a tool for the standardized assessment of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to assist the choice of instruments.
Methods
An expert panel adapted the eight attributes proposed by the Medical Outcomes Trust as evaluation review criteria, created items to evaluate them, and included a response scale for each item. A pilot test was designed to test the new tool's feasibility and to obtain preliminary information concerning its psychometric properties. The Spanish versions of five measures were selected for assessment: the SF-36 Health Survey, the Nottingham Health Profile, the COOP-WONCA charts, the EuroQol-5D, and the Quality of Life Questionnaire EORTC-QLQ-C30. We assessed the new tool's reliability (Cronbach's alpha and intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]) and construct validity.
Results
The new EMPRO (Evaluating the Measurement of Patient-Reported Outcomes) tool has 39 items covering eight key attributes: conceptual and measurement model, reliability, validity, responsiveness, interpretability, burden, alternative modes of administration, and cross-cultural and linguistic adaptations. Internal consistency was high (α = 0.95) as was interrater concordance (ICC: 0.87–0.94). Positive associations consistent with a priori hypotheses were observed between EMPRO attribute scores and the number of articles identified for the measures, the years elapsed since the publication of the first article, and the number of citations.
Conclusion
A new tool for the standardized assessment of PRO measures is available. It has shown good preliminary reliability and validity and should be a useful aid to investigators who need to choose between alternative measures. Further assessment of the tool is necessary.}

The IoT is a vast network of intelligent devices exchanging data online. The security component of IoT is crucial given its rapid expansion as a new technology paradigm since it may entail safety-critical procedures and the online storage of sensitive data. Unfortunately, security is the primary challenge when adopting Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. As a result, manufacturers’ and academics’ top priority now is improving the security of IoT devices. A substantial body of literature on the subject encompasses several issues and potential remedies. However, most existing research fails to offer a comprehensive perspective on attacks inside the IoT. Hence, this survey aims to establish a structure to guide researchers by categorizing attacks in the taxonomy according to various factors such as attack domains, attack threat type, attack executions, software surfaces, IoT protocols, attacks based on device property, attacks based on adversary location and attacks based on information damage level. This is followed by a comprehensive analysis of the countermeasures offered in academic literature. In this discourse, the countermeasures proposed for the most significant security attacks in the IoT are investigated. Following this, a comprehensive classification system for the various domains of security research in the IoT and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is developed, accompanied by their respective remedies. In conclusion, the study has revealed several open research areas pertinent to the subject matter.}

The effect of various physical and chemical factors on spore formation of Anabaena doliolum [AdS strain*)] was investigated under laboratory conditions. Among the three inorganic nitrogen sources, nitrate and nitrite (0.5 mM) were slightly stimulatory to sporulation, however, the specific growth rate was reduced in comparison to N-free grown culture. Ammonium (all concentrations) was inhibitory to growth as well as to sporulation. Dilution of phosphate in the medium was stimulatory whereas dilution of the medium was inhibitory to sporulation. Temporal relationship between spore differentiation, depletion of phosphate from the medium, and development of alkaline phosphatase activity suggest that induction of this enzyme may be considered as one of the important events preceeding sporulation. Metabolic inhibitors like sodium azide, sodium fluoride, and sodium arsenate were stimulatory either in terms of the time required for sporulation or the spore frequency. Growth rate as well as sporulation of A. doliolum was more enhanced at 32 ±2 °C than at 25 ±1 °C. Increasing light intensities (from 500lx to 3,000lx) increased the sporulation frequency with a gradual decrease in the time required for spore initiation. pH 8.0 of the medium was most suitable for sporulation.}

Application Service Providers (ASPs) have an increasing impact on how small- and medium-sized companies handle their messaging infrastructure. An ASP can help companies by outsourcing the implementation, configuration, and maintenance of a variety of services, including messaging. Although companies may derive financial benefits from reduced cost of ownership, they will also reap the benefits of allowing their overutilized staff to concentrate on more important projects than commodity messaging. This chapter explores the basic architecture of hosting Exchange 2000 and then discusses configuring Active Directory and Exchange 2000. ASPs provide access to applications (including the entire infrastructure for supporting that application) to customers who pay for access to the application in the form of a subscription. Customers access the application over the Internet or via a private leased line to the ASP's data center. There are many possibilities beyond messaging to provide services to subscribers. These include real-time conferencing, instant messaging, custom applications, and third-party add-ons.

abstract = {The Internet exposes computer users to risks from a wide variety of possible threats, including direct intrusions by exploits or social engineering, malware, and web-based attacks. Perfect network security is generally believed to be infeasible. Instead, a defense-in-depth strategy is to hinder the attacker as much as possible with multiple layers of defense, even though each layer might be surmountable. The combination of multiple layers increases the cost for the attacker to be successful, and the cost is proportional to the value of the protected assets. The cost for the attacker could be in terms of additional time, effort, or equipment. A variety of technological measures are used for layers of protection. Preventive measures aim to reduce the likelihood or potential impact of intrusions by eliminating vulnerabilities or exposure to threats. Prevention includes vulnerability assessments, software patching, system hardening, antivirus software, firewalls, and access controls. However, it is practically impossible to deter or prevent all attacks. Reactive measures are necessary to detect malicious activities and take defensive actions by blocking attacks, isolating valuable resources, or tracing the intruder. Host-based and network-based intrusion detection is an essential reactive measure that operates by a combination of misuse (signature-based) detection and anomaly (behavior-based) detection. The central issue is detection accuracy in terms of false positives and false negatives in the face of evolving, intelligent threats.}

In aqueous medium, the WHS give priority to adsorb on low-energy surface that is low polar or particularly non-polar. There is a clear corresponding relationship between the free energy and Lewis base component γ− or the hydrophile index of low-energy surface, and the specific relationship is obtained. Finally, we find hydrophobic attractive force of the Lewis acid–base interaction is mainly responsible for the absorption of WHS on low-energy surface. In short, an initial insight into adsorption behavior of WHS on low-energy surface is demonstrated in this paper.}

Of these, the subset that relates angiosperm diversity in some way to the relationship between angiosperms and insects, particularly anthophilous insects, is here the object of attention. Specifically, I address and reject the possibility that the relationship between angiosperm diversification and insects, particularly those demonstrating a preference for flowers with derived floral characteristics associated with insect pollination, may be ruled out because of asynchronous patterns of diversification in the fossil record. New data on floral structure from the Turonian of the Atlantic Coastal Plain reveal a surprising diversity of floral characters in taxa bearing tricolpate and tricolporate-derived pollen. The characters and taxa that appear in these Turonian sediments suggest that rather specific modes of insect pollination, perhaps involving highly derived insect pollinators, already existed at 90 Ma. Given the observed rate of diversification of angiosperms during that time and the pattern of evolution in insects, including what can be inferred about the history of the Apidae, these new floral data suggest that hypotheses relating angiosperm diversity to highly specific pollinators are still valid in the context of fossil evidence. Even so, consistency with fossil evidence is not necessarily proof of these relationships. In any case, there may well be multiple causes of relatively high angiosperm species diversity and understanding the relative importance of each of these requires neontological as well as paleontological investigations. One promising approach is to work within the context of phylogenetic patterns with more fossil data.}

To determine whether co-administration of soy during tibolone treatment would prevent tibolone-induced dyslipoproteinemia in postmenopausal monkeys and women.
Methods
Surgically postmenopausal cynomolgus monkeys (n=18) were assigned randomly to one of four dietary regimens in a Latin Square crossover design, such that all animals received all diets for 14 weeks with a 4-week washout period: (1) casein/lactalbumin (CL); (2) tibolone (Tib, 1.25mg/day women's equivalent); (3) soy (138mg isoflavones/day women's equivalent); (4) Soy+Tib. Postmenopausal women on tibolone treatment were randomized to receive soy powder (52g of soy protein containing 112mg isoflavones) or placebo (containing 52g of milk protein) daily in a crossover trial for 8 weeks with a 4-week washout period.
Results
Monkeys given Tib alone had ∼14% increase in plasma LDL+VLDL-C; whereas those given soy combined with tibolone had significant (∼22%) reductions. Tib treated monkeys had reductions in plasma HDL-C of about 48% vs. no reductions in Soy+Tib. In postmenopausal women using tibolone, soy reduced plasma LDL-C concentrations by ∼10% from baseline without a change in HDL-C.
Conclusions
Co-administration of soy during tibolone treatment improved the lipoprotein profile in both monkeys and women; however, the effects were more robust in monkeys.}

abstract = {Summary
Osteoporosis is a major health problem characterized by compromised bone strength that predisposes patients to an increased risk of fracture. Osteoporotic patients differ from normal subjects in bone mineral composition, bone mineral content, and crystallinity. Poor bone quality in patients with osteoporosis presents the surgeon with difficult treatment decisions. Much effort has been expended on improving therapies that are expected to preserve bone mass and thus decrease fracture risk. Manipulation of both the local fracture environment in terms of application of growth factors, scaffolds and mesenchymal cells, and systemic administration of agents promoting bone formation and bone strength has been considered as a treatment option from which promising results have recently been reported. Surprisingly, less importance has been given to investigating fracture healing in osteoporosis. Fracture healing is a complex process of bone regeneration, involving a well-orchestrated series of biological events that follow a definable temporal and spatial sequence that may be affected by both biological factors, such as age and osteoporosis, and mechanical factors such as stability of the osteosynthesis. Current studies mainly focus on preventing osteoporotic fractures. In recent years, the literature has provided evidence of altered fracture healing in osteoporotic bone, which may have important implications in evaluating the effects of new osteoporosis treatments on fracture healing. However, the mechanics of this influence of osteoporosis on fracture healing have not yet been clarified and clinical evidence is still lacking.}

In scientific literature, most authors present frameworks for scoring production processes (e.g. ratios, benchmarks). These approaches aim to reduce (material) input for producing a specific amount of goods. Hence, improved target-conditions of value streams can be designed to increase ecological efficiency and therefore decrease costs. However, the main aim of this contribution is to present an approach to combine generally accepted parameters and indicators of sustainability and VSM. This approach is based on process-oriented accounting of resource consumption along buffers, transports and processes along value streams. This model of integrating sustainability into VSM goes conform with international accepted guidelines to prevent disposals of input resources by reuse, recycle and recovery. On the one hand, following international guidelines and frameworks, this approach can be used for sustainability reporting; e.g. calculating emitted solvents per produced part, kilogram carbon dioxide equivalents per produced part (with units [kgCDE] or [kgCO2eq]), kilogram disposals per produced part, etc. On the other hand, companies will be able to calculate costs and revenues of sustainable value streams; i.e. to quantify their efforts and benefits monetary. Hence, it is necessary to immerse into material flows in value stream, material consumptions at processes, energy consumption of transports, buffers and processes in value stream, linkage of processes with scrap rates, creation of waste, etc. New data lines in VSM need to be created to represent the parameters and indicators of sustainability. The research findings will be presented by an use case from automotive industry.}

The generalized spectra of bottom seismic noise are suggested as reference curves for comparison with new data. The comparison showed a similarity in the shape and level of the generalized spectra to the noise spectra obtained recently both on the bottom and under the bottom by seismographs placed in holes drilled by the Deep-sea Drilling Project. The spectral analysis of the earthquakes recorded on the bottom of the North-west Pacific basin has shown clear maxima at frequencies of 7–17 Hz formed both by site effects and by absorption of seismic energy in the lithosphere. The frequency of spectral maxima decrease with increasing epicentral distance. Comparison of the earthquake spectra with generalized spectra of bottom noise revealed (probably) incidental coincidence in the frequencies of the minimum for noise spectra (10 Hz) and the average maximum of earthquake record spectra. The sharp mechanical impacts on a bottom seismograph, usually induced by bottom displacements under the instrument, are suggested as rough analogues of the impulses for the bottom instrument system transient calibration. Test measurements have shown that in many cases this method makes it possible to distinguish spectral peaks characterising earthquakes and seismic noise wave trains from those which are caused by coupling resonances of the OBS-sediment interface.}

The possibility of becoming a victim of cyber crime is the number-one fear of billions of people. This concern is well founded. The findings in the annual CSI/FBI Computer Crime and Security Surveys confirm that cyber crime is real and continues to be a significant threat. Traceback and attribution are performed during or after cyber violations and attacks, to identify where an attack originated, how it propagated, and what computer(s) and person(s) are responsible and should be held accountable. The goal of network forensics capabilities is to determine the path from a victimized network or system through any intermediate systems and communication pathways, back to the point of attack origination or the person who is accountable. In some cases, the computers launching an attack may themselves be compromised hosts or be controlled remotely. Attribution is the process of determining the identity of the source of a cyber attack. Types of attribution can include both digital identity (computer, user account, IP address, or enabling software) and physical identity (the actual person using the computer from which an attack originated). Cyber crime has become a painful side effect of the innovations of computer and Internet technologies. With the growth of the Internet, cyber attacks and crimes are happening every day and everywhere. It is very important to build the capability to trace and attribute attacks to the real cyber criminals and terrorists, especially in this large-scale human-built networked environment. In this chapter, we discuss the current network forensic techniques in cyber attack traceback. We focus on the current schemes in IP spoofing traceback and stepping-stone attack attribution.

However, foliar tissue senescence was shown to increase radium accumulation across a range of aquatic plant species including N. violacea (P < 0·05). Principal coordinate analysis showed that the distribution of radium and calcium concentrations in the foliar organs of N. violacea were strongly correlated (r = 0·522; P < 0·001). This result supported the hypothesis that radium was accumulated and/or distributed by the mechanisms involved in uptake of the nutrient divalent cation.

After cycle 6, the blind was broken and the trial was continued as an open trial for another 18 months for the active study arms. The study included 121 perimenopausal women recruited from the general population. Common carotid intima-media thickness and end-diastolic lumen diameter were measured at baseline and cycle 24 with B-mode ultrasonography. Results: At cycle 24 small changes in intima-media thickness and lumen diameter were observed. Relative to placebo, changes in intima-media thickness were −0.009 mm [95% CI −0.045; 0.027] for 17βE-D and −0.016 mm [95% CI −0.055; 0.024] for CEE-N. For end-diastolic lumen diameter the changes were −0.091 mm [95% CI −0.236; 0.055] and −0.125 mm [95% CI −0.820; 0.032] for 17βE-D and CEE-N, respectively. Conclusions: In this study among perimenopausal women a significant effect of 17βE-D and CEE-N on common carotid intima-media thickness and lumen diameter could not be demonstrated. Although the sample size of the present trial is too limited to provide definite conclusions, the direction of the effect is in agreement with evidence from earlier studies on the effects of hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women.}

abstract = {Since the HERA experiments H1 and ZEUS started data taking in '92, the computing environment at DESY has changed dramatically. Running a mainframe centred computing for more than 20 years, DESY switched to a heterogeneous, fully distributed computing environment within only about two years in almost every corner where computing has its applications. The computing strategy was highly influenced by the needs of the user community. The collaborations are usually limited by current technology and their ever increasing demands is the driving force for central computing to always move close to the technology edge. While DESY's central computing has a multidecade experience in running Central Data Recording/Central Data Processing for HEP experiments, the most challenging task today is to provide for clear and homogeneous concepts in the desktop area. Given that lowest level commodity hardware draws more and more attention, combined with the financial constraints we are facing already today, we quickly need concepts for integrated support of a versatile device which has the potential to move into basically any computing area in HEP. Though commercial solutions, especially addressing the PC management/support issues, are expected to come to market in the next 2–3 years, we need to provide for suitable solutions now. Buying PC's at DESY currently at a rate of about 30/month will otherwise absorb any available manpower in central computing and still will leave hundreds of unhappy people alone. Though certainly not the only region, the desktop issue is one of the most important one where we need HEP-wide collaboration to a large extent, and right now. Taking into account that there is traditionally no room for R&D at DESY, collaboration, meaning sharing experience and development resources within the HEP community, is a predominant factor for us.}

Some have changed ecosystems drastically, some slightly, some apparently scarcely at all as a result. In the light of these natural and unintentional experiments, protocols for the examination of proposals for genetic release can be derived. The risk of damage will be small, but the damage that could be caused is large. Because of the variety and subtlety of ecological interactions, some dangerous organisms will be passed as safe. Methods of control need to be considered at the time of release.}

abstract = {The Domain Name System (DNS) plays a crucial role in connecting services and users on the Internet. Since its first specification, DNS has been extended in numerous documents to keep it fit for today’s challenges and demands. And these challenges are many. Revelations of snooping on DNS traffic led to changes to guarantee confidentiality of DNS queries. Attacks to forge DNS traffic led to changes to shore up the integrity of the DNS. Finally, denial-of-service attack on DNS operations have led to new DNS operations architectures. All of these developments make DNS a highly interesting, but also highly challenging research topic. This tutorial – aimed at graduate students and early-career researchers – provides a overview of the modern DNS, its ongoing development and its open challenges. This tutorial has four major contributions. We first provide a comprehensive overview of the DNS protocol. Then, we explain how DNS is deployed in practice. This lays the foundation for the third contribution: a review of the biggest challenges the modern DNS faces today and how they can be addressed. These challenges are (i) protecting the confidentiality and (ii) guaranteeing the integrity of the information provided in the DNS, (iii) ensuring the availability of the DNS infrastructure, and (iv) detecting and preventing attacks that make use of the DNS. Last, we discuss which challenges remain open, pointing the reader towards new research areas.}

abstract = {The transplasmalemmal electrical gradient recorded in laticiferous cells at steady state was −113 ± 21 mV. Sucrose and glucose depolarize the plasmalemma of laticiferous cells by about 15 to 25 mV. Our results show that with depolarization due to sucrose (1 mM) or glucose (1 mM) a slight alkalinization (0.1 to 0.2 pH units) can be detected on the outer surface of the cell. Fructose and 3-O-methyl-glucose have no such effect. The extent of depolarization due to the addition of sugars is lower than the electrogenic component of the membrane potential produced by the functioning of the H+-excretion pump (vanadate sensitive-ATPase). Furthermore, in the presence of vanadate or DNP, with glucose or sucrose no shift in pH value was observed. The effect of phlorizin has been tested on the shift of the membrane potential due to sugar uptake across the plasmalemma: neither sucrose nor glucose demonstrate any further depolarization and alkalinization in the presence of phlorizin. Stimulation of the H+-pump by ethylene hyperpolarizes cells by approximately −40 mV and increases the extent of the depolarization induced by sugar transport. These results suggest an active transport of the sugars from the apoplasm towards the cytosol. Evidence for the existence of H+ cotransport with sucrose and/or glucose at the plasmalemma is discussed hereafter.}

abstract = {Objective: To determine the effects of oral sequential hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on lipid-profile in perimenopausal and early postmenopausal women. Methods: We performed a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. The trial was double blind with respect to 17β-estradiol/desogestrel (17β-E-D) and placebo and open with respect to conjugated estrogens/norgestrel (CEE-N). A total of 125 healthy perimenopausal and early postmenopausal women, aged 43–58 years, were recruited from the general population in Zoetermeer, the Netherlands. The intervention consisted of 6 months treatment with 1.5 mg 17β-estradiol/0.15 mg desogestrel (n=53), 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens/0.15 mg norgestrel (n=36) or placebo (n=36). At baseline, cycle 1, 3 and 6, overnight fasting blood samples were obtained in which lipids were determined. We used linear regression analysis to calculate differences in mean change from baseline in lipids in the active treatment groups compared to placebo. Results: In both treatment groups significant (P<0.05) falls in low-density-lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (17β-E-D: −7.8% and CEE-N: −8.4%) and lipoprotein(a) (17β-E-D: −11.7% and CEE-N: −28.3%) were found compared to placebo. Apolipoprotein A1 (17β-E-D: 6.8% and CEE-N: 7.3%) and HDL-cholesterol (17β-E-D: 6.4% and CEE-N: 8.0%) significantly increased compared to placebo. No significant changes were found in the other lipids. Mean changes from baseline in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B were significantly more pronounced in postmenopausal women compared to perimenopausal women, adjustment for age-differences did not change the results. Conclusion: Treatment of perimenopausal and early postmenopausal women with 17β-E-D or CEE-N changes their lipid-profile in a potentially anti-atherogenic direction. Changes appear to be more pronounced in postmenopausal women compared to perimenopausal women.}

Lifecycle models capture the dynamic nature of how such artifacts change over time in a graphical form that can be easily understood and communicated. We show how lifecycle models can be generated, and we present two industrial case studies where we applied lifecycle models to assess a project’s code review process.}

Its distribution conforms to the Hardy-Weinberg law, but the ratio of the two implicit alleles proves the originality of each population, and leads to the recognition of distinct chemotypes.}
