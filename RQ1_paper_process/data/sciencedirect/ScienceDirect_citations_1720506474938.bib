(Slack, 1870) The external form of crystals is prismatic, and bounded by straight surfaces which cut each other at certain angles. But the same form is seen in the skeletons of many of the protists, especially the flinty shells of the diatomes and radiolaria; their silicious coverings lend themselves to mathematical determination just as well as the inorganic crystals.

abstract = {Photosynthetic intermediate levels were measured in barley leaves (Hordeum vulgare L.) as a function of light, carbon dioxide concentration and leaf excision. The results were related to changes in starch, and hexose metabolism. Glucose 6-phosphate (Glc 6-P) and fructose 6-phosphate (Fru6-P) pools in barley primary leaves decreased when net photosynthesis was eliminated after a light-to-dark transition or when leaves were exposed to CO2-free air. However, the glucose 1-phosphate (Glc1-P) concentration remained constant during transitions in leaf metabolism. Glucose 1,6-biphosphate (Glc1,6-P2) levels were about 1 and 3 nmol (mg chlorophyll)−1 in dark and light barley leaves, respectively. This finding suggests that Glc1,6-P2 in plants functions primarily in gluconeogenic metabolic pathways. Changes of Glc1,6-P2 level were slower than the rapid adjustments observed in fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru2,6-P2) during shifts in metabolism, indicating that the former compound is unlikely to be a signal metabolite in plants. Hexose-bisphosphate and hexose-phosphate levels, other than Glc1-P, decreased in 72-h old barley roots after seedlings were exposed to anoxia for 24-h. Changes in Glc1,6-P2 levels in barley leaves and roots were proportional to alterations in the hexose-phosphate pool, except during the 60–90-min transition period following an abrupt shift in metabolism. Metabolite ratios indicated that phosphoglucose isomerase was slightly displaced from equilibrium in illuminated barley leaves but was near equilibrium in darkened leaves and roots. Glc1-P to Glc1-P ratios were about 6 and 2 in light and dark barley primary leaves, respectively, indicating that phosphoglucomutase was closer to equilibrium in the light than in the dark.}

Three contrasting districts in Kenya were compared: an arid and pastoral area (Samburu); a tropical highland area (Kiambu), and a tropical coastal area (Kilifi). Cattle in three districts were selected by two-stage cluster sampling between August 1991 and 1992. Schall's algorithm, a generalized linear mixed model suitable for multi-level analysis, was compared to ordinary logistic regression (OLR), which ignores clustering of responses; generalized estimating equations (GEE) or Jacknife, to account for clustering at the farm level; SAS VARCOMP, which provides normal-theory random-effects models. Schall's algorithm provided similar estimates to GEE (regression effects) and Jackknife (standard errors) for farm-level clustered data. Extending Schall's procedure for additional district and area-withindistrict random effects usually provided additional information. In general, models that included only a farm-level random effect consistently provided larger estimates of farms' variance components than did models with additional district and area random effects. The four type diseases exhibited various amounts of clustering. Brucellosis had moderate farm clustering plus some area and district clustering. Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia had only a small amount of clustering, mostly by area. Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis exhibited a large amount of clustering, primarily at the farm level. Trypanosomiasis antibody prevalence varied by district, area and farm. We believe that patterns of disease clustering identified by multi-level analysis can be used to better target high-risk units for disease control and guide research to understand disease transmission factors.}

Mutants of hIL-3 have been constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and expressed in Escherichia coli and Bacillus licheniformis. Purified muteins were assayed for induction of DNA synthesis in IL-3-dependent human cells and for binding to the IL-3 receptor. Residues at the NH2 and COOH termini together comprising one-quarter of the molecule could be removed without loss of biological function. Deletions of 6-15 residues within the central part of the molecule caused a large reduction (up to 5 logs) but no complete loss of activity. Substitution of evolutionary conserved residues resulted in a strong decrease of biological activity and demonstrated that the S-S bridge is an essential structural element in hIL-3. Interestingly, four muteins displayed a significantly higher potency of binding to the IL-3 receptor than in stimulating DNA synthesis. These results demonstrate that receptor binding may be (partly) disconnected from activation of DNA synthesis. Analysis of hIL-3 muteins demonstrated that the majority of monoclonal antibodies are directed against a small portion of the IL-3 molecule. The neutralizing potential of individual monoclonal antibodies could be increased by a combination of antibodies directed against nonoverlapping epitopes.}

abstract = {The broad trends of climatic evolution in the Southeast Indian Ocean region during the Tertiary have become clearer with the accumulation of data from Legs 28 and 29 of the Deep Sea Drilling Project. The same events which are reflected in the deep-sea sediments clearly influenced the major continental areas of Australia and Antarctica and the vegetation which covered those regions. In this review, data relating to sea-surface temperatures, to land and sea positions, and to the extent of the Antarctic ice-cap, are used to derive climatic models for the Palaeocene to latest Miocene interval: the models are correlated with vegetation history deciphered from palynological data. For most of the Palaeocene, Australia and Antarctica were joined, and lay in high southern latitudes. Sea-surface temperatures were relatively high, and there is no evidence for Antarctic ice. The postulated atmospheric circulation patterns suggest a zone of westerly winds confined to 60–80°S, and, north of that, a wide zone of erratic circulation, with deep inland penetration of rain-bearing winds. Palynological evidence from Australia indicates rainforest in the southeast, with an extension to presently arid inland South Australia. In the Eocene, Australia and Antarctica were separated by a wide gulf; water temperatures were high — in the vicinity of 20°C on the Campbell Plateau — and evidence for Antarctic ice development is meagre. Atmospheric circulation was probably sluggish, with patterns similar to those of the Palaeocene. Vegetational data show the spread of rainforest communities across Australia from the east to the southwest, and locally, inland to central Australia. Vegetation zonation appears to have been minimal on that continent. In Antarctica, late Eocene vegetation was poorly diversified. For the Oligocene, evidence for a pronounced temperature drop is both isotopic and sedimentological, and includes the first record of ice-rafting near Antarctica. Intensification of atmospheric circulation seems likely. The vegetation records suggest lowered floristic diversity in Australia, and the persistence of vegetation, again of low diversity, in Antarctica into the late Oligocene. For the Miocene, the marine record suggests the development of a major Antarctic ice-cap; in consequence, atmospheric circulations continued to intensify. Continued northward drift of Australia meant increasing aridity in regions to the north and northwest; the south and east were watered by rain-bearing westerly systems and by embryonic Trade Winds. Vegetation data in Australia suggest rainforest cover in the southeast and on the east coast, and, in the middle Miocene, the development of grasslands in interfluvial areas in the central part of the continent. The latest Miocene was marked by an intense and sudden chilling which is clearly documented in Southern Ocean sediments. This event must have caused marked precipitation decrease in much of Australia, and may coincide with the disappearance of pollen of the Nothofagus brassi type from regions west of the Great Dividing Range, although age control of this event is poor.}

In the presence of ACTH + AGI, 25-hydroxycholesterol causes additive inhibition. This effect of 25-hydroxycholesterol is dose-dependent. ACTH-stimulated steroid production from endogeneous substrates is partially inhibited by 5-cholene-3β, 24-diol. These results may just reflect substrate competition for the side-chain cleaving system or may be due to some secondary toxic effect on the cells.}

abstract = {Summary
We analysed the spatial and temporal expression of the Vicia faba legumin gene LeB4 in developing seeds of transgenic tobacco plants by means of in situ hybridization and immunohistostaining. The results indicate that the expression of the LeB4 gene is regulated in embryo and endosperm in a biphasic manner. Legumin accumulation starts during early seed development at low amounts in single cells of the integument. Accumulation proceeds successively in the proembryo, suspensor and endosperm reaching maximum levels in all cells of these organs around 10 to 12 DAP. With the beginning of the heart stage (around 13 DAP) legumin reserves disappear completely from all parts of the seed. The described early phase of legumin accumulation occurs in embryo and endosperm still before the onset of the cell expansion phase in a period of continuous mitotic activity. A second expression phase starts in embryo and endosperm around 18 DAP, as the embryo enters late torpedo stage. Within the embryo the accumulation is restricted to the parenchyma cells of cotyledons and hypocotyl, while the embryonic root and provascular tissue do not accumulate LeB4 protein. In addition, a low percentage (<10%) of cells from protoderm and calyptra was found to be involved in legumin accumulation. A comparison of LeB4 mRNA and protein distribution in embryo and endosperm revealed corresponding patterns for both expression phases. The biphasic expression of the LeB4 gene in transgenic tobacco seeds is identical to that found in V. faba for the legumin and vicilin genes during early embryogenesis (Panitz et al., 1995), but differs from that of tobacco 12S globulin genes, which are expressed in the embryo not before the late heart stage.}

abstract = {Sea-palms Postelsia palmaeformis Ruprecht are annual brown algae that grow on wave-swept rocky shores, often forming dense stands. Unlike most macroalgae, Postelsia stands upright in air-like trees. The stipe flexibility that permits Postelsia to withstand waves is provided by the low elastic modulus (5–10 MPa) of stipe tissue; in spite of the weakness (low breaking stress, ≈ 1 MPa) of this tissue, a large amount of energy (≈ 100 kJ/m3) is required to break a stipe because they can be extended by 20–25% before breaking. Although made of such easily deformed tissue, Postelsia can stand upright in air due to the width (high second moment of area) and resilience of their stipes, but the brittleness (low work of fracture, 400–900 J/m2) that accompanies this resilience renders them susceptible to breakage if they sustain deep scratches. Although wave-induced stresses experienced by individuals in aggregations are not lower than those experienced by isolated sea-palms, photon flux densities of photosynthetically active radiation within these dense groves are less than 10% of those above Postelsia canopies. A number of morphological features differ between canopy, understory, and isolated individuals. Canopy plants in dense aggregations are taller than isolated individuals and may exceed limiting proportions for elastic stability. Postelsia shows photosynthetic characteristics of “shade-adapted” plants, understory individuals being especially effective at using low light. Despite this, blade growth rates of understory plants are lower than those of either canopy or isolated individuals.}

A method novel to the quantitation of leptospiral viability was used which permitted new observations on the effect of freezing leptospires. Use of this method showed that some loss of viability occurred during freezing and/or thawing of three serotypes of leptospires with no significant additional loss during 22 months of storage in liquid nitrogen. These studies also indicated that a controlled rate of freezing was significantly better than quick freezing by immersion in liquid nitrogen. In an additional study, a hamster-virulent strain of L. canicola was frozen and gave reproducible viability and virulence titers at intervals over a 2-year period.}

abstract = {Palaeobotanical data show that during the last, or Eemian, interglacial, the climate in northern Europe was warmer than during the postglacial climatic optimum. The main warm period of the Eemian is identifiable in pollen and plant macrofossil analyses from the abundance of thermophilous species, many of which grew in Eemian time far beyond their Flandrian northern limits. These features, typical of the Eemian occurrences, were found in the Ollala interglacial site in Haapavesi, western Finland. The diatom flora, together with the plant macrofossils, showed a sequence from a marine to fresh-water environment, and thus the isolation of the sedimentary basin from the Eemian sea as a consequence of glacio-isostatic rebound. The marine diatom flora was rich, with many exotic species, indicating a higher salinity than ever found in the postglacial marine deposits in this region. Together with some other finds, the Ollala interglacial deposits (at about 116–117 m above the present sea level), suggest that the general patterns of Eemian and Flandrian uplift were largely similar, but that there were also differences in crustal deformations during these two interglacials. The ice load during the maximum phase of each glaciation determines the amount of crustal downwarping, but the deglaciation history and changes in the geographical distribution of the ice load during the melting phase are other important factors, responsible for the shape of the land uplift regions.}

Three major protein species are found in the cocoa bean: an albumin of molecular mass 21 kDa (p21) and two insoluble vicilin-like proteins of molecular mass 31 kDa and 47 kDa (p31 and p47, respectively). The p31 and p47 species are known to be derived from a common 67-kDa precursor (p67) by post-translational processing that includes the deletion of a hydrophilic domain located immediately after an N-terminal signal sequence. All three proteins appear to be targeted to membrane-bound storage organelles by N-terminal signal sequences. The p21 and p67 coding sequences were expressed in Hansenula polymorpha using the powerful methanol oxidase (MOX) promoter and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using the promoter of the pyruvate kinase (PYK) gene. The expression constructs contained the native plant signal sequence, or various yeast signals. The p21 protein was successfully expressed and secreted from both yeasts. The insoluble p67 protein proved more difficult. Species of the correct molecular mass were recovered internally and small amounts of a p47 species were secreted using a yeast leader sequence. However, proteolytic cleavage, probably due to Kex2p-like processing, led to the appearance of other protein species.}

A panel of antibodies raised against restricted regions of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) were employed for epitope mapping studies of this 66 kDa PHF protein. Western blot studies revealed that C-terminal APP antibodies were immunoreactive with the 66 kDa PHF protein. Further analysis revealed that only antisera raised against peptides that include the beta/A4-amyloid region within the C-terminal portion of APP were immunoreactive with PHF proteins. These data complement previous immunocytochemical studies which indicated that C-terminal APP antibodies preferentially label PHF-containing neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's brain. The present data suggest a similarity of secondary or tertiary structure between beta/A4-amyloid and PHF which accounts for the cross-reactivity of beta/A4-amyloid antibodies with PHF proteins.}

abstract = {Manufacturers of automated systems and their components have been allocating an enormous amount of time and effort in R&D activities, which led to the availability of prototypes demonstrating new capabilities as well as the introduction of such systems to the market within different domains. Manufacturers need to make sure that the systems function in the intended way and according to specifications. This is not a trivial task as system complexity rises dramatically the more integrated and interconnected these systems become with the addition of automated functionality and features to them. This effort translates into an overhead on the V&V (verification and validation) process making it time-consuming and costly. In this paper, we present VALU3S, an ECSEL JU (joint undertaking) project that aims to evaluate the state-of-the-art V&V methods and tools, and design a multi-domain framework to create a clear structure around the components and elements needed to conduct the V&V process. The main expected benefit of the framework is to reduce time and cost needed to verify and validate automated systems with respect to safety, cyber-security, and privacy requirements. This is done through identification and classification of evaluation methods, tools, environments and concepts for V&V of automated systems with respect to the mentioned requirements. VALU3S will provide guidelines to the V&V community including engineers and researchers on how the V&V of automated systems could be improved considering the cost, time and effort of conducting V&V processes. To this end, VALU3S brings together a consortium with partners from 10 different countries, amounting to a mix of 25 industrial partners, 6 leading research institutes, and 10 universities to reach the project goal.}

Moreover, the current middleware tools are not able to straightforwardly provision the ephemeral and specific environments that certain codes and simulations require. These facts prevent the massive portability of legacy applications to cloud environments. Such an issue can be overcome by effectively scheduling the distributed calculations using the basic capacities offered by cloud federations. In this work, a framework achieving such a goal is presented: a pilot system (GWpilot) that has been improved with cloud computing capabilities (GWcloud). This framework profits from the expertise acquired in grid federations and provides interesting features that make it more efficient, flexible and useable than other approaches. Thus, decentralisation, middleware independence, dynamic brokering, on-demand provisioning of specific virtual images, compatibility with legacy applications, and the efficient accomplishment of short tasks, among other features, are achieved. Not only this, the new framework is multi-user and multi-application, dynamically instantiating virtual machines depending on the available and demanded resources, i.e. allowing users to consolidate their own resource provisioning. Results presented in this work demonstrate these features by efficiently executing several legacy applications with very different requirements on the FedCloud infrastructure at the same time.}

Forty-two case studies are selected based on seven quality assessment standards and then, analyzed to answer seven research questions which help to protect cloud environments from various attacks, issues, and challenges. The analysis of case studies shows a description of the most common security issues in cloud; machine learning and deep learning models that are applied, datasets models, performance metrics, machine learning and deep learning based countermeasures and defences that are developed to prevent security issues.

abstract = {Observing a pitched visual field (i.e. tilted around a horizontal axis in the observer's frontal plane) results in large changes in the elevation visually perceived to correspond to eye level (VPEL) and in the perceived elevation and size of stationary objects viewed against the field. With topforward pitch (top toward observer) VPEL lies above true eye level and objects appear smaller and lower; with topbackward pitch VPEL lies below true eye level and objects appear larger and higher. Oscillation of the pitched field induces synchronous perceived oscillation of elevation of a stationary target viewed against the field. Typical VPEL settings deviated from true eye level by 20° with the field pitched at 40°, although some individuals mislocalized by as much as 40°. VPEL varied linearly with visual field pitch with individual slopes for the relation between VPEL and visual field pitch ranging from +0.42 to +0.78 (avg = +0.56). The linear correlation (r) between VPEL in darkness and against an erect visual field was +0.91. The two relations—VPEL vs visual field pitch, VPEL in darkness vs VPEL in the erect illuminated visual field (slope ≈ 0.5)—are both accurately predicted by the linear model: VPEL = kvV + kbB; in which V is the influence of visual field structure and B is the influence of the body-referenced mechanism which combines information regarding the orientation of the head relative to gravity, the position of the eye in the orbit, and the vertical location of the image on the retina; kv and kb are the relative weights of V and B with kv + kb = 1. In an illuminated field kv = kb ≈ 0.5; in the dark kv = 0, kb = 1.}

But in Indonesia, the combination of late development and an authoritarian state has created a particularly potent mix, one that has raised more questions than usual about the effects of growth, trade, and investment on labor conditions and local standards of living. The basic motives of foreign direct investment (FDI) are said to create a pattern that is inherently ripe for exploitation, since the capital, technology and market access all rest with the foreign investor. The author uses the Indonesian case to explore factors that might reduce exploitation. While conceding that foreign investment is likely to affect labor conditions in the host economy, especially in times of rapid growth, she cautions against presuming that the consequences will be mainly negative with respect to the living standards and basic human rights of the local population.}

To test whether these inhibitors had any effect on adrenal steroid production, independent from the mechanism of action of ACTH, we investigated their effect on the conversion of 25-hydroxycholesterol into corticosterone in isolated rat adrenal cells. Cycloheximide, both in the absence and in the presence of ACTH, had no effect on this conversion. Chloramphenicol inhibited the conversion of 25-hydroxycholesterol into corticosterone whether ACTH was present or not. The results with Cycloheximide indicate that ACTH has no direct effect on the cholesterol side-chain cleaving system. The inhibition by chloramphenicol of the ACTH-stimulated steroid production is at least partly due to inhibition of one or more of the processes involved in the conversion of 25-hydroxycholesterol into corticosterone.}

Alveophoma is distinct from Phomopsis and Phoma Sacc. on account of the sympodial development of the conidiophores. As a result of comparative studies on several hyaline-spored pycnidial fungi related to Phoma, it is suggested that separation of genera on the basis of conidium and conidiophore development will provide a more satisfactory approach to the classification of pycnidial fungi.}

This study examined the influences of (+)-WAY-100135, claimed to be the first selective 5-HT1A antagonist, on offensive behaviour in male mice. Employing a resident-intruder paradigm, administration of (+)WAY-100135 (1.0–10.0 mg/kg sc) enhanced elements of resident offensive behaviour at 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg but reduced such behaviour at 10.0 mg/kg. In comparison, resident defensive postures remained unchanged except for a significant increase in defensive sideways behaviour at 10.0 mg/kg. These effects were accompanied by reduced rearing behaviour across the dose range tested. Attend/approach behaviour was significantly reduced at the lowest, but increased at the highest, doses tested. Such results may reflect response competition rather than concomitant motor impairment. Given the dynamic behavioural interactions occurring in this paradigm, the increased offensive behaviour of the resident mice leads to enhanced defence and counter-attack by the intruder conspecifics. The results are discussed with reference to the current literature concerning the behavioural effects of other 5-HT1A antagonists.}

abstract = {On treating the blue-green alga Anacystis nidulans with dimethylsuberimidate up to 70% of the free NH2 of the photosynthetic membrane is amidinated, and presumably inter- and intramolecular cross-links are established in the membrane proteins. Amidination destroys the ability of A. nidulans to photoreduce HCO3− but leaves the photochemical activities of Photosystems II and I nearly intact. With added electron acceptors, photosynthetic O2 evolution can be demonstrated both with permeable cells (permeaplasts) prepared by digestion of the cell wall of dimethylsuberimidate-reacted A. nidulans with lysozyme, as well as with heavy membrane particles (36 000 × g) prepared from dimethylsuberimidate-reacted cells. Permeaplasts prepared from dimethylsuberimidate-reacted cells resist damage in hypoosmotic medium, whereas those prepared from unreacted cells are induced to release C-phycocyanin. On the other hand, the former are inactivated more easily by heat stress than the latter. On this basis, it is concluded that cross-linking with dimethylsuberimidate confers functional instability to photosynthetic membranes.}

abstract = {The determination of methyl- and ethylmercury halides in environmental and biological samples typically involves gas chromatography with electron-capture detection. However, these organomercury halides are notorious for their poor chromatographic characteristics (severe tailing, decomposition, low column efficiencies) on packed columns. The problems can be temporarily alleviated by column passivation using a concentrated organic solution of mercury(II) chloride. Attempts to use capillary columns instead, to improve the chromatographic behaviour of organomercury halides, have met with mixed success, and the results presented generally show poorer performance than that obtained using packed columns, even after passivation. To eliminate the problem at its source (the polar mercury-halide bond), it is proposed to butylate the mercury species with a Grignard reagent to yield the non-polar dialkyl derivatives. As the electron-capturing halide moiety is absent from these derivatives, mercury-specific detection is necessary, and a microwave-induced plasma emission detector is utilized. In combination with capillary gas chromatography, unprecedented column and separation efficiencies for methyl- and ethylmercury are achieved. The practical utility of the method is illustrated in a preliminary application to the determination of mercury species in a fish tissue reference material after extraction and butylation.}

Different tools and middleboxes, such as performance enhancement proxies, network monitors and policy enforcement devices, base their functions on the knowledge of the applications generating the traffic. This requirement is tightly coupled to an accurate traffic classification, being exacerbated by the (daily) expanding set of apps and the moving-target nature of mobile traffic. On the top of that, the increasing adoption of encrypted protocols (such as TLS) makes classification even more challenging, defeating established approaches (e.g., Deep Packet Inspection). To this end, in this paper we aim to improve the performance of classification of mobile apps traffic by proposing a multi-classification (viz. fusion) approach, intelligently-combining outputs from state-of-the-art classifiers proposed for mobile and encrypted traffic classification. Under this framework, four classes of different combiners (differing in whether they accept soft or hard classifiers' outputs, the training requirements, and the learning philosophy) are taken into account and compared. The present approach enjoys modularity, as any classifier may be readily plugged-in/out to improve performance further. Finally, based on a dataset of (true) users' activity collected by a mobile solutions provider, our results demonstrate that classification performance can be improved according to all considered metrics, up to +9.5% (recall score) with respect to the best state-of-the-art classifier. The proposed system is also capitalized to validate a novel pre-processing of traffic traces, here developed, and assess performance sensitivity to traffic object (temporal) segmentation, before actual classification.}

The action ofmelatonin is apparently not mediated by dopaminergic systems, because the behavioural changes were not antagonized by local pretreatment with haloperidol or sulpiride. Injection of serotonin antagonists (methysergide and cyproheptadine) into the nucleus accumbens resulted in similar behavioural changes as was found after treatment with melatonin. Treatment with serotonin and various antidepressant drugs (zimelidine, mianserin, nortriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine) injected into the nucleus accumbens, completely inhibited the melatonin-induced behavioural responses. The antidepressants did not significantly interfere with the decrease of locomotor activity and rearing induced by injection of small doses of the dopamine agonist, apomorphine, into the nucleus accumbens. p ]These results suggest that there is an interrelationship between melatonin and serotonin systems in the nucleus accumbens and showed that various antidepressant drugs, similar to serotonin, antagonized the behavioural effects of melatonin after injection into the nucleus accumbens.}

Species diversity was greater at the impacted site, which was characterized by associations between soil characteristics and vegetation that were unlike those found at control sites.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide foundations for a working hypothesis on drug-induced functional neuroteratology. A class of centrally acting antihypertensive drugs, including clonidine, which are still being prescribed during pregnancy in humans, is used as the model. A hypothesis is put forward in this chapter which proposes that behavioral state-dependent changes in monoaminergic neuronal firing levels and patterns play a key role during early ontogeny in regulating neuron membrane potential, neurotransmitter release and neurotransmitter receptor sensitivity patterns in adulthood. Neurons show spontaneous activity that varies as a function of the behavioral state of the organism. This has been demonstrated for noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC), serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe (DR), dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra (SN) and cholinergic neurons of the dorsolateral part of the pons and basal forebrain. Because centrally acting antihypertensives predominantly affect the noradrenaline (NA) system in the brain, the induced modifications of central NA neurotransmission is also emphasized in this chapter.}

A statistically significant difference in attenuation between these subcortical gray nuclei and adjacent white matter was detected by computer analysis of numerical printouts even though this difference was often not visually perceptible on our first generation-type CCT scanner. Slight, but statistically significant increased attenuation occurs with contrast enhancement and affects both the basal ganglia and surrounding white matter.

This study evaluated the relation of ENF to corneal nerve regeneration utilizing a model of heptanol-induced epithelial wounding. The organ culture technique was used to collect ENF from the intact corneal epithelium, and a neuronal bioassay was utilized to quantify ENF. The results revealed no change in ENF secretion either during initial wound closure or after 1 week, when the epithelium had regenerated. However, ENF secretion was elevated 2·4 times in 2 weeks after wounding. Morphometric analysis of corneal nerves stained by gold chloride impregnation showed that the first sign of regeneration of intraepithelial nerves was observed after 2 weeks, and the normal pattern of epithelial neural density was re-established after 3 weeks. However, the neural density was still subnormal (35–47% less than the control) in the wounded epithelium up to 4 weeks after wounding. Thus it appears that a surge in ENF secretion occurred after epithelial regeneration but before nerve regeneration. The results suggest that ENF may mediate corneal nerve regeneration.}

In particular, due to immigration and birth rates, Mexican Americans are the largest and fastest growing segment of the Latino population. This paper addresses some of the most significant historical and socio-cultural factors contributing to the psychological nature and wellbeing of Mexican Americans. These factors should be understood and used to guide research and theory in order to make the discipline of psychology relevant for Mexican Americans. The concept of mestizaje is used to explain the biological and cultural mixing constituting the diverse origins of the Mexican people. Immigration to the U.S. is described in terms of selective socio-cultural variables giving rise to a diverse Mexican American culture that is resistant to complete assimilation. Within a U.S. context, the constructs of generational status, acculturation, and biculturalism are used to explain the socio-cultural adaptation of Mexican Americans. The special role of children in immigrant families as language and cultural brokers are also discussed, and used to explain the adjustment of Mexican American families.
Resumen
Para que el campo de la Psicología en los Estados Unidos siga manteniendo su relevancia y validez, debe incluir en mayor medida, tanto en su teoría como en la investigación práctica, a las poblaciones hispanas, grupo que en la actualidad compone la “minoría” más numerosa de la nación. En concreto, debido a la inmigración y las tasas de natalidad, los mexicano-estadounidenses son el segmento más amplio y de mayor crecimiento dentro de la población hispana. El presente artículo aborda algunos de los factores históricos y socio-culturales más significativos en la naturaleza y bienestar psicológico de los mexicanoestadounidenses. Estos factores deben ser comprendidos y utilizados como guía en la investigación y el desarrollo teórico para que la disciplina de psicología incluya a la población mexicano-estadounidense. Se emplea el concepto de mestizaje para explicar la mezcolanza biológica y cultural que da pie a la diversidad de orígenes de la población mejicana. Se describe la inmigración a los EEUU en base a variables socioculturales selectivas que conforman una cultura mexicano-estadounidense diversa que se resiste a una total asimilación. Dentro del contexto norteamericano, los constructos de estatus generacional, aculturación y bi-culturalismo son utilizados para explicar la adaptación socio-cultural de los mexicano-estadounidenses. También se aborda el papel especial que desempeñan los niños de familias inmigrantes en cuanto al idioma y la cultura y su importancia en el proceso de adaptación de las familias mexicano-estadounidenses.}

Given the industrial practice of only using semi-formal notations for describing engineering processes – with the lack of proper tool mapping – engineers and developers need to invest a significant amount of time and effort to ensure that all steps mandated by quality assurance are followed. The sheer size and complexity of systems and regulations make manual, timely feedback from Quality Assurance (QA) engineers infeasible. In order to address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for tracking, and “passively” executing processes in the background, automatically checking QA constraints depending on process progress, and informing the developer of unfulfilled QA constraints. We evaluate our approach by applying it to three case studies: a safety–critical open-source community system, a safety–critical system in the air-traffic control domain, and a non-safety–critical, web-based system. Results from our analysis confirm that trace links are often corrected or completed after the work step has been considered finished, and the engineer has already moved on to another step. Thus, support for timely and automated constraint checking has significant potential to reduce rework as the engineer receives continuous feedback already during their work step.}

Auxiliary detectors for projectile tracking and isotope identification completed the setup. The measured differential cross sections were analyzed using the Glauber multiple-scattering theory.

The nuclear-matter radii and radial density distributions of the isotopes 12,14Be were deduced. Extended nuclear-matter density distributions were observed in both isotopes, and the halo structure of 14Be was confirmed. The results were also compared with microscopic few-body and fermionic molecular dynamics model calculations concerning the structure of these neutron-rich nuclei.}

In this chapter, we survey Android-related security risks and vulnerabilities, as well as conduct a systematic evaluation of 15 popular free antimalware apps using 11 known malware samples collected between Feb. 27, 2014 and Aug. 3, 2014 from the Contagio Mobile Malware Mini Dump database. By conducting a manual experiment to replicate potential day-to-day threats to users unknowingly installing malicious apps (i.e., malware samples), the evaluation produced results that varied significantly across all three Android operating systems and hardware test devices. We hope the findings will contribute to a better understanding of the effectiveness and reliability of such apps for Android devices, as well as improved antimalware apps and detection rates.}

abstract = {The correlation between the effects of pH, ionic strength and cation valency on the electrophoretic mobility and the extent of adhesion of suspension-cultured Catharanthus roseus cells to various polymer substrates is presented. The electrophoretic mobility of cells was unaltered in the pH range of 6–8, but decreased from approximately −2.2 × 10−8 m V−1 s−1 and approached zero as the pH of the suspending liquid was decreased from 6 to 2. Similarly, the value of electrophoretic mobility decreased continuously as the ionic strength was increased from 0 to 1.0 M when cells were suspended in salt solutions of sodium chloride, calcium chloride, and aluminium chloride. However, using equimolar concentrations, the slope of the decrease in electrophoretic mobility increased following the sequence sodium chloride < calcium chloride < aluminium chloride. The electrophoretic mobility was near zero for suspensions containing 1.0 M calcium chloride or 0.1 M aluminium chloride. The extent of adhesion of the cells to the polymers sulphonated polystyrene < polyethylene terephthalate < polystyrene < fluorinated ethylene-propylene followed this sequence. These results agree with a thermodynamic model of plant cell adhesion that implicates the importance of interfacial tensions in the adhesion process. However, higher levels of adhesion were generally observed when the electrophoretic mobility for the cells in the corresponding test liquid was at a minimum absolute value. These results can be explained by considering the effects of the electrolytic properties of the suspending liquid on the electrostatic repulsive interactions between the cells and the polymer surface in terms of a double-layer phenomenon and the DLVO theory. Consideration of results presented here along with kinetic studies of plant cell adhesion indicates that cell-cell, rather than cell-substrate repulsion, may play the more important role in modifying the extent of adhesion.}

After twelve months use, the implants were replaced with a new set of capsules. The contraceptive effectiveness of the second and subsequent set of implants was similar to that of the first. Five NET implants failed completely to prevent pregnancy and 4 MA implants combined with 2 d-Ng implants were as effective as 6 MA implants. Other doses tested were: 5 MA, 3 d-Ng, and 4 MA plus 1 d-Ng. They were significantly less effective than the higher doses. No adverse effect upon the outcome of unplanned pregnancies was noted and prompt recovery of fertility was observed after termination of treatment. Ovulation took place in most cycles of women treated with 5 or 6 MA implants, as judged from the occurrence of LH peak in urine, pregnanediol excretion, changes of cervical mucus, BBT, and endometrial biopsy. Intermenstrual bleeding was by far the most common side effect recorded. Initially, it occurred in about 30 % of the cycles, but the incidence decreased gradually and by the end of the second year, it was below 10 %. Adnexal complications were observed in some of the treatment groups.}

We fed 58 men 0, 3, 6, or 9 g/d of fish oil for 12 months and monitored fatty acids in serum cholesteryl esters, erythrocytes, and subcutaneous fat during and after supplementation. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in cholesteryl esters plateaued after 4-8 weeks; the incorporation half-life was 4.8 days. Steady-state levels increased by 3.9 +/- 0.3 mass ﹪ points (+/- SE) for each extra gram of EPA eaten per day. Incorporation of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was erratic; plateau values were 1.1 +/- 0.1 mass ﹪ higher for every g/d ingested. Incorporation of EPA into erythrocyte membranes showed a half-life of 28 days; a steady state was reached after 180 days. Each g/d increased levels by 2.1 +/- 0.1 mass ﹪. C22:5n-3 levels increased markedly. Changes in DHA were erratic and smaller. EPA levels in adipose tissue rose also; the change after 6 months was 67﹪ of that after 12 months in gluteal and 75﹪ in abdominal fat. After 12 months each gram per day caused an 0.11 +/- 0.01 mass ﹪ rise in gluteal fat for EPA, 0.53 +/- 0.07 for C22:5n-3, and 0.14 +/- 0.03 for DHA. Thus, different (n-3) fatty acids were incorporated with different efficiencies, possibly because of interconversions or different affinities of the enzymatic pathways involved. EPA levels in cholesteryl esters reflect intake over the past week or two, erythrocytes over the past month or two, and adipose tissue over a period of years. These findings may help in assessing the intake of (n-3) fatty acids in epidemiological studies.}

Techniques were developed which yield reproducible analyses for Re/Os at the 2%‰ level and which permit complete isotopic exchange between sample and tracer, as is necessary for concentration measurements of Re and Os by isotope dilution. High precision osmium and rhenium isotope data have been obtained using negative ion thermal ionization, with ionization efficiencies of up to 10% for Os and 20% for Re, both for normals and for Re and Os extracted from the samples. Replicate analyses of Re/Os are in good agreement, within ±2.5%o. The results show a well defined correlation line on a 187Re-187Os evolution diagram for iron meteorites from groups IAB, IIAB, IIIAB, IVA, and IVB, all taken together. This correlation line yields a slope of 0.07863 ± 0.00031 (2σ) and initial 187Os/188Os = 0.09560 ± 0.00018 (2σ). If the individual groups of iron meteorites for which there is sufficient dispersion in Re/Os are considered, data on the IIAB and on the IVA irons appear to indicate a difference in age of 60 ± 45 Ma, with the IVA group being older. This age difference is qualitatively the same as obtained for PdAg data but is larger. Sulphides from two IAB iron meteorites show extremely low concentrations of Re and Os and indicate that Re and Os are not partitioned into this phase during planetary differentiation. There is evidence for recent element remobilization or contamination, corresponding to relative enrichment of Re or loss of Os in the sulphides. Schreibersites contain small but significant amounts of Re and Os, with high Re/Os relative to the metal phases and with 187Os/188Os much more radiogenic than in the metal. Model ages for the Schreibersites are relatively young (4.3–3.5 AE) and indicate that the Schreibersites were open-systems for ReOs at least 0.5–1 AE after the original formation of the iron meteorites. It now appears possible to use metal- schreibersite pairs to determine internal isochrons. Based on the schreibersite model ages, the cooling rates for the two IAB meteorites are estimated to be ∼ 1°C/Ma, more than an order of magnitude lower than the most recently determined metallographic cooling rates for IAB irons (Herpfer et al., 1994).}

Within the regions studied deposits are to be found in the whole area between the Pleistocene marine terraces — situated only a few meters above sea-level — and the limit of the Pleistocene glaciations. These deposits can be interpreted as glacial frost-climate formations. Whilst in higher altitudes indications of great mass-movements were found, above all solifluction mantles, in middle altitudes formations of increased wash-off become prominent. In basin-areas, which are situated in the proximity of the sea, the accumulation of loess prevailed. On the basis of the data available at present, the greatest part of these formations appears to belong to the last glaciation (Wuerm). In some localities, however, deposits were found, which are likely to originate from older glaciations.
Zusammenfassung
In den untersuchten Gebieten kommen im gesamten Bereich zwischen den nur wenige Meter über dem Meeresspiegel liegenden pleistozänen marinen Terrassen und der Grenze der pleistozänen Vergletscherungen Ablagerungen vor, die als kaltzeitliche frostklimatische Bildungen gedeutet werden können. Während in den höheren Lagen Anzeichen starker Massenbewegungen, vor allem Solifluktionsdecken gefunden wurden, treten in einem mittleren Höhengürtel Bildungen verstärkter Abspülung in den Vordergrund. In den meernahen Beckenlagen dominierte die Löß-Akkumulation. Aufgrund der gegenwärtig verfügbaren Daten scheint der größte Teil dieser Bildungen in die letzte Kaltzeit (Würm) zu gehören. An einigen Stellen sind jedoch auch Ablagerungen gefunden worden, die wohl in älteren Kaltzeiten entstanden sind.}

Preliminary results with a small number of litters revealed significant dose-dependent effects in tests performed prior to weaning (surface righting, pivoting locomotion, and bar holding), as well as in tests performed after weaning (motor coordination, open-field behavior, and motor activity). Exposure to low concentrations of styrene (50 ppm) caused disturbances in motor coordination in addition to delaying some motor and reflex developments. Large doses (300 ppm) led to changes in open-field behavior and increases in spontaneous activity in addition to the delay in neurobehavioral developments. Exposure of dams to styrene did not clearly affect the learning behavior of the offspring. It was also observed that age played a role in the differences in styrene's effects on neurobehavioral function. Only subtle effects were found in both open-field behavior and motorcoordination function when compared with control rats at 120 days of age. These results suggest that the functional neurobehavioral development of progeny of dams exposed to styrene (or other solvents) should be further investigated.}

The loss of enzymic activity was accompanied by a concomitant reduction in enzyme protein, as shown by inununoblotting. Addition of LPS to the culture medium resulted also in the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNT), and the fall in lipoprotein lipase in LPS-treated cultures could be prevented by an antibody to TNF. Addition of recombinant human TNF to the heart cell cultures also depressed lipoprotein lipase activity. LPS treatment of preadipocytes in culture resulted in a fall in lipoprotein lipase activity and TNF production. Since TNF is known as a macrophage product, the cultures were tested for phagocytic capacity, and only 0.2–1.3% of the cells were shown to engulf Staphylococcus albus. Immunofluorescent staining with monoclonal antibodies OX-1, which identify leukocyte common antigen, was negative, and only 0.1 ± 0.07% of the cells were positive after staining with OX-42 antibody to iC3 receptor. Both antibodies stained more than 98% of rat peritoneal macrophages used as controls. Since LPS treatment of macrophages at numbers comparable to or exceeding the number of phagocytic cells present in the heart cell cultures did not induce measurable amounts of TNF, it is suggested that in the heart cell cultures, TNF may be produced by cells other than macrophages.}

The solution is then used to reduce the three-dimensional problem to two dimensions and to express all characteristic features of the stress and deformation states of the shell in terms of six functions, namely the coordinates of the displacement and stress vectors defined on the middle surface. Use of the first two terms of the series obtained yields an applied theory free of any hypotheses and intended for removing the external load from the front surface of the shell. A similar approach to the problem of constructing applied theories was first used in /2–4/ which made wide use of the resources of tensor analysis.}

abstract = {An empirical model of Skeletonema costatum photosynthetic rate is developed and fit to measurements of photosynthesis selected from the literature. Because the model acknowledges existence of: 1) a light-temperature interaction (by allowing optimum irradiance to vary with temperature), 2) light inhibition, 3) temperature inhibition, and 4) a salinity effect, it accurately estimates photosynthetic rates measured over a wide range of temperature, light intensity, and salinity. Integration of predicted instantaneous rate of photosynthesis with time and depth yields daily net carbon assimilation (pg C cell−1 day−1) in a mixed layer of specified depth, when salinity, temperature, daily irradiance and extinction coefficient are known. The assumption of constant carbon quota (pg C cell−1) allows for prediction of mean specific growth rate (day−1), which can be used in numerical models of Skeletonema costatum population dynamics. Application of the model to northern San Francisco Bay clearly demonstrates the limitation of growth by low light availability, and suggests that large population densities of S. costatum observed during summer months are not the result of active growth in the central deep channels (where growth rates are consistently predicted to be negative). But predicted growth rates in the lateral shallows are positive during summer and fall, thus offering a testable hypothesis that shoals are the only sites of active population growth by S. costatum (and perhaps other neritic diatoms) in the northern reach of San Francisco Bay.}

abstract = {The first part of this presentation considers some of the complexities of parasitic infections and parasite-specific effector mechanisms which have hampered the development of practical methods of immunisation against parasitic diseases. In the second part, an outline is given of the effector mechanisms involved in immunity of cattle to the protozoan parasite Theileria parva. Parasites are antigenically complex organisms which often have distinct developmental stages, sometimes with different predilection sites within the host. Antigenic polymorphism between strains is a common feature of parasites and sometimes results in strain-specific immunity. Certain parasites have also evolved mechanisms of modulating surface antigens which allow them to escape host effector mechanism. Effector mechanisms which control parasitic infections may operate by preventing establishment of the parasites, by eliminating the parasites once they have established or by affecting growth or fecundity of the parasites. In addition to specific antibody and cell-mediated immune responses, inflammatory or physiological responses play an important role in the control of some parasites. Current evidence suggests that effector mechanisms against T. parva parasites operate at two levels. First, antibodies produced against the infective stage of the parasite, the sporozoite, can, by neutralising infectivity, reduce the numbers of organisms which establish in the host. Second, cytotoxic T cells directed against parasitised lymphoblasts cause destruction of parasites following their establishment in the host. Moreover, in situations where immunity is parasite strain-specific, the cytotoxic T cell responses have also been found to be strain-specific. The elucidation of these effector mechanisms has indicated potential new strategies of immunisation against T.parva.}

abstract = {Upon transfer into a liquid medium devoid of a nitrogen source, vegetative cells of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii undergo a gametogenic differenciation process to give rise to sexually active gametes that are capable of mating with opposite mating type gametes. Striking differences have been demonstrated in the mating efficiency (0 to 100%) of gametes induced at different vegetative growth stages in the light-dark synchronized culture. This difference in mating efficiency of gametes is independent of mating-type but directly related to the growth stage of the synchronized vegetative cultures at the time of gametogenic induction. In contrast to the synchronized culture, the mating efficiency of gametes in the continuous light, nonsynchronized vegetative culture is independent of the growth stage at the time of gametogenic induction. The mating behavior of gametes appears to be rather unstable since the mating efficiency of a given clone can be altered considerably during routine maintenance of the culture. Not all the progeny of a particular strain inherit the identical mating efficiency of their parents. The stability of the mating behavior and the transmittance of the mating behavior to the vegetative progeny have been found to vary among different clones. The high frequency at which the mating behavior alters suggests that the mating behavior is a rather complex expression of a number of different factors.}

The first experiment was carried out in a glasshouse with different sowing conditions (1, 3 and 5 cm sowing depths, 2 and 5 mm wet or dry crusts) and two seed weight ranges. The final emergence percentages (40–94%) and times from 50% germination to 50% emergence (55–105°Cd) varied widely. Seed weights had a marked influence only in the most extreme conditions. Seedling growth was then analysed in growth chambers at two temperatures (10 and 20°C), for the same two seed weight ranges and different times of growth in the dark. Hypocotyl elongation rates and growth forces decreased when this time increased. Heavy seeds had longer final hypocotyl lengths and greater growth forces, which explained their better emergence from deep sowing and with surface obstacles. Growth after emergence both in the glasshouse and growth chamber was influenced by seed weight and time from germination to emergence: the seedling weight at emergence depended only on initial seed weight; the seedling relative growth rate was not influenced by the initial seed weight, but decreased with increase in time before emergence. This was due to a decrease in cotyledon photosynthetic efficiency. Poor seedbed structure and seed placement control affect not only emergence but also early growth. These results provide basic information for modelling the emergence and early growth of dicotyledon epigeal seedlings.}

Coincident observations of the display were made from 23.55 UT until 00.50 UT. By projecting the image of the noctilucent cloud structure as seen by one camera into the field of view of the other camera, the height of the clouds was found to be 82 ± 1 km. Using this result, the effect of atmospheric screening on the visible border of the noctilucent clouds was determined. Taking account of the refraction on the solar grazing rays illuminating the clouds at the visible border and the finite angular diameter of the sun's disc, the altitude of the screening layer was determined to be 7 ± 1 km. Thus, on this occasion, the screening effect of the atmosphere was confined to the troposphere and was probably caused by atmospheric haze and/or tropospheric cloud. This result contrasts markedly with the high values of screening height, ~ 30 km, deduced from measurements made earlier this century, also using the visible boundary of the clouds. The analysis presented herein indicates that these large values were probably in error, due to the poor dynamic range of the photographic films employed.}

Outbreaks of Take All in oats have often been reported in recent years from Wales, and occasionally from Australia, Denmark and Holland, although in most parts of the world it is commonly held that oats resist the disease. Isolates of Ophiobolus from oats grown in Wales were indistinguishable in cultural behaviour from O. graminis, but they were very pathogenic to oats, which were found to be highly resistant to ordinary O. graminis. This histology of the infection of oat plants by the fungus from Wales and by O. graminis was studied in detail. It was found that there were significant differences between the two groups of isolates in the length and septation of the ascospores, the Welsh material giving a length of 101–117µ, the English material 79–86µ The fungus from Welsh oats is therefore regarded as a new variety, Ophiobolus graminis Sacc. var.

The IoT consists of systems of integrated objects, computing devices, digital, or mechanical machines that are given the ability to transmit and receive the data over a network without the need for human interaction. Each of these devices can operate independently within the existing Internet infrastructure. Issues will continue to increase as devices become more prevalent and continuously evolve to counter newer threats and schemes. The attack surface of a network sums up all penetration points, otherwise known as attack vectors. An attacker or an unauthorized user can take advantage of these attack vectors to penetrate and change or extract data from the threat environment. For this research, we define a threat model that allows us to systematically analyze the security solutions to mitigate potential risks from the beginning of the design phase. By designing an IoT architecture and breaking it down into several zones, we focus on each zone to identify any vulnerability or weaknesses within a system that allows unauthorized privileges, as well as any attacks that can target that area. We also investigate the available IoT devices across several domains (e.g., wellness, industrial, home, etc.) to provide a 1:1 and 1:n mapping across devices, vulnerabilities, and potential security threats based on the subjective assessment.}

The propagation velocity within each layer may be constant or depend linearly on the distance perpendicular to the top of the layer. A seismic source, generating rays travelling in either P or S mode, may be located anywhere within the model. Whenever a ray intersects an interface, reflection or transmission and, if desired, change in mode of propagation can be specified. Travel time is computed for each ray, and propagation is terminated on encountering the free surface or a model boundary. Model and rays can be plotted. The advantages of this specialized program over well-known more general programs for ray tracing in laterally heterogeneous media are shortness, simplicity, and fast interactive operation.}

Analysis of the biphasic relaxation patterns in terms of the kinetic model published previously (Wang, J., Wehner, G., Benz, R. and Zimmermann, U. (1991) Biophys. J. 59, 235–248) demonstrated that extracellular DIDS dramatically reduced the translocation rate, KAS, of the Cl−-carrier complex (maximal inhibition 79%). The translocation rate of the free carrier molecules, KS, as well as the total surface concentration of the carrier, No, were not affected. A Hill-plot of DIDS inhibition on KAS yielded an half-maximal inhibition concentration (IC50) of 3.9 · 10−5 M and a Hill-coefficient of 1.61, suggesting a co-operative binding of the inhibitors to the Cl−-carrier. The maximal inhibition of DIDS was dependent on the extracellular Cl−-concentration. This inhibition was not competitive to chloride, since it increased and did not decrease with increasing chloride concentration. The DIDS effect decreased with increasing pH-value (investigated pH range between 6.5 and 10). Intravacuolar DIDS or SITS (4-acetamido-4′-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid) had no effect on the biphasic voltage relaxation pattern. These results showed that the binding sites of DIDS must be located on the outer surface of the plasmalemma of V. utricularis and, in turn, supported previous conclusions that the Cl−-carrier (which is assumed to be part of the turgor-pressure-sensing mechanism) is only located in the outer membrane.}

abstract = {Modern macroeconomists prefer the Q approach for modelling aggregate investment despite the empirical superiority of Jorgenson's ‘neo classical’ approach. This paper revisits this conflict. Its theoretical and empirical results make the case that, in contrast to the original static Q investment equation, a new dynamic Q equation is as satisfactory as Jorgenson's equation from an empirical standpoint while being more satisfactory from a theoretical standpoint. The paper identifies a theoretical and an empirical line of research in resolving the conflict between theorists and empiricists. On the theory side, the possibility of generating lags in a Q investment equation via the structural Q model is explored: This period's investment cost depends on the investment level achieved last period. The interpretation of this intertemporality combines adjustment costs and gestation lags. The closed-form Q equation is an ARMAX. The explicit generation of lagged investment therefore accounts for the key stylized fact characterizing the investment data process. The empirical line of research turns to data puzzles in the specification of a viable Q equation. It reconciles inter alia the ‘non-Q evidence’ which claims a paramount link between stock prices and investment with the ‘Q non-evidence’ which denies such a link exists. More importantly, the ARMAX Q equations is systematically gauged against the Jorgenson and accelerator specifications across six OECD countries.
