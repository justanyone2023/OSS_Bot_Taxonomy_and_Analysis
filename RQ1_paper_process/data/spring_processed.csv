164--185,"Proceedings of the Future Technologies Conference (FTC) 2023, Volume 4","Generative AI for text-based applications have gained in popularity with the release of ChatGPT in late 2022 by OpenAI. Users engage with the application via a web-based user interface or programmatically via the API. The details of the model internals and specifics on the training have not been made public, which poses several challenges in better understanding the system. It would be advantageous to have insight into the system to better understand the occurrence of bias and issues pertaining to privacy, among other concerns. These aforementioned issues could be better addressed if the code base used for training these large language models were made publicly available. Since the release of ChatGPT and its underlying technologies, there have been various open-source platforms that have become publicly available. This survey presents an analysis of four open-source platforms for chat-based generative AI. These specific platforms include Open Assistant, Colossal AI, ChatLLaMA and OpenChatKit. This survey evaluates each of the four open-source platforms for chat-based Generative AI based on evaluative criteria consisting of understandability, setup and configuration, community and support, regularity of code updates, as well as system compatibility and efficiency.",,,Cham,Springer Nature Switzerland,978-3-031-47448-4,2023,A Comparative Survey of Open-Source Platforms for Chat-Based Generative AI,"Kurivella, Pavan Kumar

580--594,Advances in Computational Intelligence Systems,"Aiming at the first steps toward de-coupling the application of multi-robot systems from reliance on network infrastructure, this paper proposes a human-friendly verbal communication platform for multi-robot systems, following the deliberately designed principles of being adaptable, transparent, and secure. The platform is network independent and is subsequently capable of functioning in network-deprived environments--from underwater scenarios to planet exploration. A series of experiments were conducted to demonstrate the platform's capability in multi-robot systems communication and task co-ordination, showcasing its potential in infrastructure-free applications. To benefit the community, we have made the code open source at https://github.com/jynxmagic/MSc{\_}AI{\_}projectGitHub.",,,Cham,Springer Nature Switzerland,978-3-031-47508-5,2024,A Human-friendly Verbal Communication Platform for Multi-Robot Systems: Design and Principles,"Carr, Christopher

A brief overview of the solutions existing in this area was carried out, a flowchart reflecting the algorithm of the bot, and images demonstrating the appearance of its interface are presented. The bot has been successfully tested for performance: with equal input data, the conclusion about the TRL level obtained at the output of the algorithm coincides with the result of an expert assessment in accordance with GOST R 58048-2017. It is proposed to use the bot as a source of another additional opinion about the level of technological readiness of the project.",,,Singapore,Springer Nature Singapore,978-981-19-3444-5,2022,Development of a Telegram Bot to Determine the Level of Technological Readiness,"Suntsova, Darya I.

284--308,Applied Cryptography  and Network Security,"One of the new developments in chit-chat bots is a long-term memory mechanism that remembers information from past conversations for increasing engagement and consistency of responses. The bot is designed to extract knowledge of personal nature from their conversation partner, e.g., stating preference for a particular color. In this paper, we show that this memory mechanism can result in unintended behavior. In particular, we found that one can combine a personal statement with an informative statement that would lead the bot to remember the informative statement alongside personal knowledge in its long term memory. This means that the bot can be tricked into remembering misinformation which it would regurgitate as statements of fact when recalling information relevant to the topic of conversation. We demonstrate this vulnerability on the BlenderBot 2 framework implemented on the ParlAI platform and provide examples on the more recent and significantly larger BlenderBot 3 model. We generate 150 examples of misinformation, of which 114 (76{\%}) were remembered by BlenderBot 2 when combined with a personal statement. We further assessed the risk of this misinformation being recalled after intervening innocuous conversation and in response to multiple questions relevant to the injected memory. Our evaluation was performed on both the memory-only and the combination of memory and internet search modes of BlenderBot 2. From the combinations of these variables, we generated 12,890 conversations and analyzed recalled misinformation in the responses. We found that when the chat bot is questioned on the misinformation topic, it was 328{\%} more likely to respond with the misinformation as fact when the misinformation was in the long-term memory.",,,Cham,Springer Nature Switzerland,978-3-031-33488-7,2023,"Those Aren't Your Memories, They're Somebody Else's: Seeding Misinformation in Chat Bot Memories","Atkins, Conor

147--161,Cross-Cultural Design,"Bots are becoming more widely adopted in GitHub, with implications for online knowledge collaboration. It is necessary to study the extent of the impact of bots in online knowledge collaboration. A total of 843 projects with around 63125 aggregate data were acquired by crawling projects through GitHub API and filtering out projects that do not contain code or do not have any issues. Preliminary research found no correlation between the adoption of bots and the popularity of the project, while most of the literature support a positive correlation. But further classified observation according to the attributes of the bot, we found that projects with dedicated bots were more popular than projects with template bots. The study found that the adoption of dedicated bots for projects led to an increase in commit, fork, and issue count, which affected the addition, reorganization, and integration of knowledge collaboration. The study also found that projects with dedicated bots received more attention, with a positive correlation between fork count and star count, but no significant correlation between commit, issue count and star count. The impact of bots in online knowledge collaboration is still lacking in terms of adding and integrating knowledge.",,,Cham,Springer Nature Switzerland,978-3-031-60901-5,2024,Research on the Collaborative Mechanism of Project Robots in Online Knowledge Production Communities: An Analysis of GitHub,"Wang, Ziyu

However, websites may employ web bot detection. When they do, their response to a bot may differ from responses to regular browsers.

86--97,Artificial Intelligence in HCI,"Within the ever-evolving domain of software development, the practice of having teams located in different geographical locations presents distinct obstacles, including disparate time zones, language hurdles, and differing degrees of experience. This paper presents a novel approach to address these difficulties by using an automated GitHub bot that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to enforce SOLID principles during code reviews. This bot, which incorporates advanced models such as OpenAI's GPT-4 and the locally deployable Mixtral, has the objective of delivering immediate and practical feedback. Its purpose is to improve the quality of code and make learning easier for developers, particularly those who are new to programming. The bot's structure enables effortless incorporation into GitHub, utilizing LLMs to examine code modifications and offer observations regarding adherence to SOLID principles. An important characteristic of this method is the incorporation of Mixtral, which may be operated on-site, providing advantages in terms of data confidentiality and operational adaptability, essential for global enterprises with strict privacy demands. Here, we explores the bot's architecture, its incorporation with LLMs, and its capacity to revolutionize code reviews by offering a secure, efficient, and instructive instrument for geographically dispersed software development teams.",,,Cham,Springer Nature Switzerland,978-3-031-60615-1,2024,The Use of Large Language Model in Code Review Automation: An Examination of Enforcing SOLID Principles,"Martins, Gustavo F.

381--389,Applied Information Processing Systems ,Enhancing software productivity would help companies to cut their costs and increase profits. Software metrics rely heavily on the personal experiences and skills of managers in pattern recognition and rewards. Differentiating between actual human effort and machine-generated code can help drive an organization's decision-making process that is rewarding its employees and provide an assistive tool to the managers allowing effective monitoring without micromanagement that has a wide application in managing work from home and other virtual environments. The paper explores the insight into the quality of machine-generated bot code compared to actual human coding efforts. It uses machine learning techniques to identify patterns and gives intelligent insights that can be used as a performance metric for versioning systems and business intelligence.

Various Web services are used using their APIs so as to make it more powerful and less dependent on python packages. It operates completely on Linux (Ubuntu) terminal. Python command with the {\_}{\_}main{\_}{\_}.py file has been used to run it. Terminal then becomes a live Web-based chatbot service with STT and TTS services.

51--61,Conceptual Modeling,"Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is an emerging technology for automating tasks using bots that can mimic human actions on computer systems. Most existing research focuses on the earlier phases of RPA implementations, e.g. the discovery of tasks that are suitable for automation. To detect exceptions and explore opportunities for bot and process redesign, historical data from RPA-enabled processes in the form of bot logs or process logs can be utilized. However, the isolated use of bot logs or process logs provides only limited insights and not a good understanding of an overall process. Therefore, we develop an approach that merges bot logs with process logs for process mining. A merged log enables an integrated view on the role and effects of bots in an RPA-enabled process. We first develop an integrated data model describing the structure and relation of bots and business processes. We then specify and instantiate a `bot log parser' translating bot logs of three leading RPA vendors into the XES format. Further, we develop the `log merger' functionality that merges bot logs with logs of the underlying business processes. We further introduce process mining measures allowing the analysis of a merged log.",,,Cham,Springer International Publishing,978-3-030-62522-1,2020,Bot Log Mining: Using Logs from Robotic Process Automation for Process Mining,"Egger, Andreas

187--202,Web Engineering,"Bots, i.e., algorithmically driven entities that behave like humans in online communications, are increasingly infiltrating social conversations on the Web. If not properly prevented, this presence of bots may cause harm to the humans they interact with. This paper aims to understand which types of abuse may lead to harm and whether these can be considered intentional or not. We manually review a dataset of 60 Twitter bot code repositories on GitHub, derive a set of potentially abusive actions, characterize them using a taxonomy of abstract code patterns, and assess the potential abusiveness of the patterns. The study does not only reveal the existence of 31 communication-specific code patterns -- which could be used to assess the harmfulness of bot code -- but also their presence throughout all studied repositories.",,,Cham,Springer International Publishing,978-3-030-19274-7,2019,On Twitter Bots Behaving Badly: Empirical Study of Code Patterns on GitHub,"Millimaggi, Andrea

Few studies have been published on gaming industry malware. The ones identified were found to be primarily focused mainly on in-game cheat detection, such as cheat clients and aimbots. This paper leverages related research drawn from the broader field of cybersecurity, including, URL-phishing detection and crytpojacking. To detect URL phishing attacks data, we used eight filter, wrapper, and embedded-based feature selection and five machine learning techniques, i.e., AdaBoost, extra trees (ET), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and gradient boosting (GB) where highest accuracy, precision, recall, and F1{\_}score are achieved with RF. We further scrutinize the feature selection and classifiers based on threshold that will help to provide an aggregate simplified recommendation to the user and alerting about the malicious URL. The outcome of whether the URL is benign or malicious can easily be seen on developed bot application named ``Fish Finder.''

183--214,Software Ecosystems: Tooling and Analytics,"Large-scale software development has become a highly collaborative and geographically distributed endeavor, especially in open-source software development ecosystems and their associated developer communities. It has given rise to modern development processes (e.g., pull-based development) that involve a wide range of activities such as issue and bug handling, code reviewing, coding, testing, and deployment. These often very effort-intensive activities are supported by a wide variety of tools such as version control systems, bug and issue trackers, code reviewing systems, code quality analysis tools, test automation, dependency management, and vulnerability detection tools. To reduce the complexity of the collaborative development process, many of the repetitive human activities that are part of the development workflow are being automated by CI/CD tools that help to increase the productivity and quality of software projects. Social coding platforms aim to integrate all this tooling and workflow automation in a single encompassing environment. These social coding platforms gave rise to the emergence of development bots, facilitating the integration with external CI/CD tools and enabling the automation of many other development-related tasks. GitHub, the most popular social coding platform, has introduced GitHub Actions to automate workflows in its hosted software development repositories since November 2019. This chapter explores the ecosystems of development bots and GitHub Actions and their interconnection. It provides an extensive survey of the state of the art in this domain, discusses the opportunities and threats that these ecosystems entail, and reports on the challenges and future perspectives for researchers as well as software practitioners.",10.1007/978-3-031-36060-2_8,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-36060-2_8,Cham,Springer International Publishing,978-3-031-36060-2,2023,The GitHub Development Workflow Automation Ecosystems,"Wessel, Mairieli
